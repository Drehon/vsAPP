ISSUE 1

update doesn't reference the public repository from 1.3.9 to 1.4.0
as in, once i have installed 1.3.9
instead on checking on vsAPP-public if 1.4.0 or later updates are out
it checks on vsAPP 

this mean we need to FIRST fix 1.3.9
so that it can do that 

then publish 1.4.0 too
to test if 1.3.9 updates to 1.4.0 (published only to public)
and to test that 1.3.9 doesn't update even if i upload 1.4.0 to non-public

and start over if it fails and it still updates off the wrong repository

---

ISSUE 2

npm run publish 
this command publishes directly to the public repo
it shouldn't based off what we had agreed/completed

instead it should publish normally to the private one
then the correct process should be me running the following command
npm run publish-public
this should copy the release from the private repository to the public one 

basically
npm run publish >>> to vsAPP
npm run publish-public >>>> copy release from vsAPP to vsAPP-public

---

once we have verified both issue have been addressed
i'll set the vsAPP repository to private
