# Refactoring Companion for uniform.txt

This file tracks the execution of the refactoring plan outlined in uniform.txt.

## Phase 1: Foundation - The Content Hydration Engine

### Step 1: Create the Central Hydrator (Completed)

- **File Created**: `src/sub-functions/content-hydrator.js`
- **Details**: The file was created and exports a placeholder `hydrateContent(paneElement)` function.

---

### Step 2: Refactor the Content Loader (Completed)

- **File Modified**: `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`
- **File Modified**: `src/sub-functions/content-hydrator.js`

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **Standardized Module Exports**: Changed `content-hydrator.js` to use ES Module `export` syntax instead of CommonJS `module.exports` to ensure consistency with the rest of the codebase.
2.  **Simplified `content-loader.js`**:
    - Removed the imports for the old, specialized initializers (`exercise-initializer.js`, `grammar-exercise.js`, `verb-exercise.js`).
    - Imported the new, universal `hydrateContent` function from `content-hydrator.js`.
    - Deleted the large `if/else if` block that checked the `filePath` to decide which initializer to run.
    - Added a single, unconditional call to `hydrateContent(contentWrapper)` after injecting the HTML into the content pane.

**Outcome:**

The `content-loader.js` module is now significantly simplified. Its sole responsibility is to fetch and inject HTML content. It no longer contains brittle, path-based logic for initialization. All initialization logic is now delegated to the `content-hydrator.js` module, fulfilling the requirements of Phase 1, Step 2 of the refactoring plan.
