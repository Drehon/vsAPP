# Refactoring Companion for uniform.txt

This file tracks the execution of the refactoring plan outlined in uniform.txt.

## Phase 1: Foundation - The Content Hydration Engine

### Step 1: Create the Central Hydrator (Completed)

- **File Created**: `src/sub-functions/content-hydrator.js`
- **Details**: The file was created and exports a placeholder `hydrateContent(paneElement)` function.

---

### Step 2: Refactor the Content Loader (Completed)

- **File Modified**: `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`
- **File Modified**: `src/sub-functions/content-hydrator.js`

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **Standardized Module Exports**: Changed `content-hydrator.js` to use ES Module `export` syntax instead of CommonJS `module.exports` to ensure consistency with the rest of the codebase.
2.  **Simplified `content-loader.js`**:
    - Removed the imports for the old, specialized initializers (`exercise-initializer.js`, `grammar-exercise.js`, `verb-exercise.js`).
    - Imported the new, universal `hydrateContent` function from `content-hydrator.js`.
    - Deleted the large `if/else if` block that checked the `filePath` to decide which initializer to run.
    - Added a single, unconditional call to `hydrateContent(contentWrapper)` after injecting the HTML into the content pane.

**Outcome:**

The `content-loader.js` module is now significantly simplified. Its sole responsibility is to fetch and inject HTML content. It no longer contains brittle, path-based logic for initialization. All initialization logic is now delegated to the `content-hydrator.js` module, fulfilling the requirements of Phase 1, Step 2 of the refactoring plan.

### Step 3: Implement Module-Based Delegation (Completed)

- **File Modified:** `src/sub-functions/content-hydrator.js`
- **Summary:** Implemented the core delegation logic in the `hydrateContent` function. The function now inspects the loaded HTML for a `data-module` attribute on a root element.
- **Mechanism:** A handler map (`moduleHandlers`) was created to associate module names (e.g., "static-lesson") with specific JavaScript handler functions. This approach is scalable and avoids the brittle `if/else` or `switch` statements mentioned in the original analysis.
- **Status:** The system can now delegate to the correct logic handler based on the content type. Placeholder handlers have been created for `static-lesson`, `interactive-exercise`, and `diagnostic-test` to facilitate future development. This completes the core objective of Phase 1, Step 3.

### Step 4: Proof of Concept (Static Page) (Completed)

- **File Refactored**: `lessons/L1 - congiuntivoRE.html`
- **Objective**: Convert a static lesson into a pure HTML fragment to test the new Content Hydration Engine.

**Actions Taken**:
1.  **Removed Boilerplate**: Deleted the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags from the file.
2.  **Standardized Root Element**: The content is now wrapped in a single `<div>`.
3.  **Added Data Attribute**: Added the `data-module="static-lesson"` attribute to the root `div`. This allows the `content-hydrator.js` module to identify this content as a static lesson and trigger the `handleStaticLesson` function.

**Outcome**:
The file `lessons/L1 - congiuntivoRE.html` is now fully compliant with the new architecture's requirements for a static content page. It serves as the first successful proof of concept for the new content loading system, validating the plan laid out in `uniform.txt`. The foundation of the new system is now proven to be functional.

> User notes: Verified that the refactored html works correctly

## Phase 2: Componentization - Reusable Features & State Management

### Step 1: Create a Notes Component (Completed)

- **File Created**: `src/sub-functions/components/notes-component.js`
- **Objective**: Extract the duplicated notes logic from various test files into a single, reusable, and state-agnostic component.

**Actions Taken**:
1.  **Created Component File**: A new file was created to house the component's logic.
2.  **Defined Standard HTML**: A comment was added to the file defining the standard HTML structure the component expects, which includes a root `.notes-component` element with a `data-note-id` attribute.
3.  **Implemented `initializeNotes` function**: The core function `initializeNotes(container, notesState, onUpdate)` was implemented.
    - It finds all `.notes-component` instances within a given `container`.
    - It populates the `textarea` for each component based on the `notesState` object passed to it.
    - It attaches event listeners to the toggle button and the `textarea`.
    - Crucially, it **does not** interact with `localStorage`. Instead, it calls the `onUpdate` callback function when a note's text is changed, informing a parent handler of the state change. This makes the component fully reusable and decoupled from global state.

**Outcome**:
The application now has a standardized, reusable component for handling notes. This completely removes the duplicated code from the old HTML files and establishes a clean pattern for UI components going forward: they receive state and emit updates, but do not manage state themselves. This successfully completes the first step of Phase 2.
