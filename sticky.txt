The tabs were unstickied after some modifications to index.html.
My first attempt to fix this by adding `sticky`, `top-0`, and `z-10` to the `tab-bar` was unsuccessful.
My second attempt involves adding `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` to the `content-panes` div. I also kept the changes from the first attempt.
This should prevent the content from overlapping the tab bar and help the browser to correctly calculate the sticky positioning.

My third attempt is to make the `content-panes` div the scrolling container instead of the `body`.
I have removed `h-screen` from the `body` element and added `overflow-y-auto` and `h-screen` to the `content-panes` div.
This should make the tabs sticky as they will be positioned relative to the scrolling `content-panes` div.
THIRD ATTEMPT WAS REVERTED CAUSE IT BROKE A LOT OF STUFF

My fourth attempt was to revert the third attempt and remove the background color from the content-panes div. This did not work either. The final state of index.html is with the body having h-screen and the content-panes having overflow-y-auto and no background color. The tabs are sticky, but the background issue persists.
