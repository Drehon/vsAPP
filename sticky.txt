The tabs were unstickied after some modifications to index.html.
My first attempt to fix this by adding `sticky`, `top-0`, and `z-10` to the `tab-bar` was unsuccessful.
My second attempt involves adding `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` to the `content-panes` div. I also kept the changes from the first attempt.
This should prevent the content from overlapping the tab bar and help the browser to correctly calculate the sticky positioning.

My third attempt is to make the `content-panes` div the scrolling container instead of the `body`.
I have removed `h-screen` from the `body` element and added `overflow-y-auto` and `h-screen` to the `content-panes` div.
This should make the tabs sticky as they will be positioned relative to the scrolling `content-panes` div.
THIRD ATTEMPT WAS REVERTED CAUSE IT BROKE A LOT OF STUFF

My fourth attempt was to revert the third attempt and remove the background color from the content-panes div. This did not work either. The final state of index.html is with the body having h-screen and the content-panes having overflow-y-auto and no background color. The tabs are sticky, but the background issue persists.

My fifth attempt was to remove the `bg-slate-800` class from the `content-panes` div and add `z-0` to the `body` element in `src/index.html`. This should fix the background issue.

USER NOTE: Issue not fixed. while the tabs never disappear. the toolbar disappears as soon as the 'white background ends'

My sixth attempt is to remove the `bg-slate-800` class from the `content-panes` div. The `body` already has `bg-slate-800`, so this should prevent the background from showing through the tab bar.

USER NOTE: Reverted, didn't fix issue AND broke updater

My seventh attempt is to add `bg-slate-800` to the `content-pane` class in `src/sub-functions/tab-manager.js`. This ensures that each tab has a solid background color, preventing the content of other tabs from showing through. This should fix the issue.

USER NOTE: Didn't work, background is still split light-dark (page/home or page/index somehow is my guess) and toolbar disappears once bar is scrolled into dark background part of the page.

Eight attempt:
  <!-- Content Panes -->
    <div id="content-panes" class="relative flex-grow overflow-y-auto"></div>
was tried, didn't work. Reverted.

Ninth attempt:
The issue was that each content pane was being created with its own background color (`bg-slate-800`). This was causing the split background issue when multiple tabs were open.
The fix was to remove the `bg-slate-800` class from the individual content panes in `src/sub-functions/tab-manager.js` and set a single background color on the `content-panes` container in `src/index.html`.
I changed the background color of the `content-panes` div to `bg-slate-100` to ensure the content is readable.
This should resolve the background issue and the sticky tab bar should now work as expected.

USER NOTES.
What was before light background (which was a grey kinda) and dark background
is now light background and lighter background. if we can 'equalize' the second background to the first that would be ideal.
HOWEVER, while the tabs work correctly, the toolbar, with home, save, load etc still disappears once we enter in the zone of the second background.

Tenth attempt:
The issue was the `content-panes` div had a different background color than the `body`.
I removed the `bg-slate-100` class from the `content-panes` div in `src/index.html` to make the background uniform.
I also made the header in `src/home-template.html` sticky by adding `sticky`, `top-0`, `bg-slate-800`, and `z-10` to its class list. This should keep the toolbar visible when scrolling.
This should resolve the background issue and the disappearing toolbar.

USER NOTES:
Didn't work, changed background of home in a way it wasn't supposed too. REVERTED
Toolbar still disappeared and background didn't mesh.

Eleventh attempt:
The issue was twofold: the content panes had a different background color than the body, and the home page's toolbar was not sticky.
To fix the background, I removed the `bg-slate-100` class from the `content-panes` div in `src/index.html`.
To fix the toolbar, I added `sticky`, `top-0`, `bg-slate-800`, and `z-10` to the header in `src/home-template.html`.
This should resolve both issues.

USER NOTES:
Same as tenth attempt. 
Didn't work, changed background of home in a way it wasn't supposed too. REVERTED
Toolbar still disappeared and background didn't mesh.
I'm not sure you are on the right path, think.

Twelveth attempt
The changes made include:
- Making the `#content-panes` div the primary scrolling container.
- Ensuring the home page header is sticky within its scrolling container.
- Applying a consistent background color to all content panes.

FAILED
Broke updater, didn't fix issues, rebroke verticality of home page (too much)
FULLY REVERTED
