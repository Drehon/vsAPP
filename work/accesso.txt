Regarding your question: "can we keep a list of users somehow on github to be referenced?"

Storing a list of users, especially with passwords, directly in a GitHub repository is not secure. Even if the repository is private, it's not designed for storing sensitive user data. A much better and standard practice is to use a database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB) to store user information. For the purpose of this implementation, we will start with a simple JSON file to represent our user data, but with the strong recommendation to move to a proper database for any real-world application.

Here is the plan to implement the username-password system with "remember me" functionality:

**Plan:**

1.  **Create a `users.json` file:** To store user data, I will create a new file named `users.json`. This file will serve as a temporary, file-based database for users. It will contain an example user entry. (This is the first step I will implement now).
2.  **Create a login page:** I will create a `login.html` file with a form for username, password, and a "remember me" checkbox.
3.  **Implement login logic:** I will add logic to the application's backend to handle the login process. This will involve reading the `users.json` file, verifying credentials, and managing user sessions.
4.  **Implement "Remember Me":** I will add the "remember me" functionality, which will allow users to stay logged in across sessions using a secure token stored in a cookie.
5.  **Implement logout:** I will add a logout feature to allow users to securely end their sessions.
