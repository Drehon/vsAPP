# Summary of Refactoring Work and Deviations from Plan (Phases 1-3)

This document summarizes the work completed during the first three phases of the architectural refactoring outlined in `uniform.txt`. It covers the key achievements and highlights the significant challenges and deviations from the original, simplistic plan.

## Phases 1 & 2: Foundation and Componentization

**Documentation:** `work/refacto-12.txt`

The first two phases of the project proceeded largely according to the original plan and were highly successful in establishing the new architecture's foundation.

### Key Achievements:
- **Content Hydration Engine:** The brittle, path-based `if/else` logic in `content-loader.js` was successfully replaced with a robust, data-driven `content-hydrator.js`. This new engine uses a `data-module` attribute to delegate rendering to appropriate handlers.
- **Static Content Migration:** All static lesson pages in the `lessons/` and `lessonsAN/` directories were successfully converted into pure, standardized HTML fragments, proving the viability of the new system.
- **Universal State Management:** State management was decisively decoupled from the file system. The system now uses a logical `data-page-id` to save and load progress, making it more robust and scalable.
- **Componentization:** A reusable, state-agnostic notes component was successfully created, establishing a clear pattern for future UI components.

**Deviations from Plan:** None. These foundational phases were executed as planned.

## Phase 3: Interactive Module Refactoring & Unforeseen Complexity

**Documentation:** `work/refacto-3.txt`

Phase 3, focused on migrating the first simple interactive exercises, represented a significant deviation from the original plan. The initial plan was overly optimistic and did not account for the deep-seated architectural issues that would be uncovered. The successful completion of this phase required extensive, iterative debugging and major architectural changes not originally anticipated.

### Major Deviations and Challenges:

1.  **Challenge: The Stateful Singleton Handler**
    *   **Problem:** The most significant unforeseen issue was that the `exercise-handler.js` module was designed as a stateful singleton. This caused critical, hard-to-debug failures where the UI would become unresponsive when switching between multiple exercise tabs, as they all shared and corrupted a single state context.
    *   **Deviation/Resolution:** A major architectural pivot was required. The handler was completely refactored from a single exported function into a **JavaScript Class**. The `content-hydrator` was updated to create a new, isolated `ExerciseHandler` instance for each exercise tab, storing it on the tab object itself. This was a critical deviation that ensures tab state is properly encapsulated, making the application robust for multi-tab use.

2.  **Challenge: Broken UI Feedback due to Build Process**
    *   **Problem:** A persistent bug prevented visual feedback (green/red highlights on answers) from appearing. Multiple attempts to fix this by modifying the JavaScript logic failed.
    *   **Deviation/Resolution:** The root cause was not a logic error but a **misconfigured build process**. The project's CSS build step was broken, meaning any changes to the source CSS files (`src/index.css`) were never compiled into the final stylesheet loaded by the application (`src/style.css`). As fixing the build system was out of scope, a pragmatic workaround was devised: the necessary CSS rules were manually compiled and **injected directly into the final `style.css` file**.

3.  **Challenge: Iterative State Management Bug-Fixing**
    *   **Problem:** The save, load, and reset functionality was plagued by numerous bugs, including race conditions and logical flaws in the content-loading pipeline. For example, a reset would delete the save file on disk, but the stale state would persist in memory, making the reset appear to have failed.
    *   **Deviation/Resolution:** This required multiple, iterative rounds of debugging and fixes, going far beyond the scope of the original plan. The logic in `content-loader.js` and `tab-manager.js` was repeatedly refined to ensure the `pageId` was available at the right time and that in-memory state was correctly nullified when a save file was not found.

### Conclusion

While Phases 1 and 2 established a solid foundation as planned, Phase 3 revealed the true complexity of refactoring the application's stateful, interactive components. The successful outcome was only achieved by significantly deviating from the original plan to address unforeseen architectural flaws. The resulting system—with its class-based handlers and robust state lifecycle—is far more stable and scalable than the one envisioned in the initial, simplistic plan.

## Phase 4: Full-Scale Migration & The Diagnostic Handler (Re-evaluated Plan)

This section outlines the revised, detailed plan for Phase 4. It is based on the original goals in `uniform.txt` but heavily informed by the critical lessons learned during the complex refactoring of Phase 3. This plan prioritizes architectural robustness and acknowledges the practical challenges of the development environment.

### Step 1: Create the Diagnostic Test Handler Class
- **Action:** Create the new file `src/sub-functions/handlers/diagnostic-test-handler.js`.
- **Architecture:** The handler will be implemented as a **JavaScript Class** (`DiagnosticTestHandler`). This is a critical lesson from Phase 3 to prevent state corruption and UI freezes when multiple diagnostic test tabs are open. Each tab will get its own isolated instance.
- **Integration:** The `content-hydrator.js` module will be updated to import this new class and instantiate it for any content with `data-module="diagnostic-test"`, storing the instance on the tab object (e.g., `tab.exerciseInstance`).

### Step 2: Implement Core Structure and Block-Based Rendering
- **Action:** The handler's main responsibility will be to read the `#page-data` JSON island and render the entire test.
- **Layout:** As per the original plan, all exercise blocks will be rendered on a single page to be submitted sequentially.
- **Rendering:** The handler will reuse rendering logic from `exercise-handler.js` where possible, dynamically creating questions based on their `type`. A "Submit Block" button will be rendered at the end of each block.

### Step 3: Implement Visual Feedback and State Management
- **Action:** Implement the answer-checking logic that runs when a "Submit Block" button is clicked.
- **Visual Feedback:**
    - The handler will apply CSS classes (`.btn-correct`, `.btn-incorrect`, `.input-correct`, etc.) to provide clear visual feedback.
    - **Contingency Plan:** Based on the experience from Phase 3, the plan explicitly includes a step to **manually add the required CSS rules to `src/style.css`** if they do not apply correctly. This addresses the known issue with the broken CSS build process.
- **State Management:** All user progress (answers, submitted blocks) will be saved to `tab.exerciseState` and persisted using the existing `autoSave` mechanism, ensuring robustness.

### Step 4: Implement Advanced Diagnostic Features
- **Review Mode:** After the final block is submitted, the handler will disable all inputs, putting the test into a "review mode."
- **Diagnostics View & Charting:**
    - A dedicated diagnostics area will be rendered at the top or bottom of the page.
    - This area will display overall scores and performance metrics.
    - It will include a `<canvas>` element for a Chart.js graph. The chart data will be generated by aggregating the `category` property of each question, and the chart will be updated after each block is submitted.

### Step 5: Migrate the First Diagnostic Test (`student-grammar.html`)
- **Action:** Convert `others/student-grammar.html` into a universal HTML fragment.
- **Configuration:** Set `data-module="diagnostic-test"` and a unique `data-page-id`.
- **Data Migration:** Refactor the test's questions and configuration into the standardized `#page-data` JSON format, including `blocks`, question `types`, and `category` tags.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the migrated page to ensure all features work as expected.

### Step 6: Migrate the Second Diagnostic Test (`student-verbs.html`)
- **Action:** Repeat the migration process for `others/student-verbs.html`.
- **Validation:** This step serves to validate the generic, data-driven nature of the `DiagnosticTestHandler`.
- **Custom Renderers:** Pay special attention to unique formatting requirements (e.g., the "email" layout mentioned in `uniform.txt`) and implement support for them, likely via a `renderer` property in the JSON data, as originally envisioned.

### Step 7: Final Cleanup
- **Action:** Once both diagnostic tests are fully migrated and functional, the following obsolete files will be deleted:
    - `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js`
    - `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`
- **Verification:** Perform a final code review to ensure no legacy logic remains and the refactoring is complete.

Bonus step:
Verify the app can still function entirely offline.
If this means downloading the chart, direct the developer to download it and tell him where to place it.
Then prepare the code accordingly.

## Phase 4 Progress Log

### Step 1: Create the Diagnostic Test Handler Class (Completed)
- **Summary:** The foundational work for the new diagnostic test module is complete. This involved creating the new handler as a JavaScript class to ensure state is properly encapsulated, a key lesson from the refactoring of `exercise-handler.js` in Phase 3.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Created File:** A new file, `src/sub-functions/handlers/diagnostic-test-handler.js`, was created.
    2.  **Defined Class:** A new `DiagnosticTestHandler` class was defined and exported from this file. It includes a basic constructor that mirrors the structure of the `ExerciseHandler` for consistency.
    3.  **Integrated with Hydrator:** The `content-hydrator.js` module was updated to import and instantiate the `DiagnosticTestHandler`. It now correctly delegates any content with `data-module="diagnostic-test"` to a new, isolated instance of the handler, preventing the state-sharing issues encountered in previous phases.
- **Outcome:** The architectural foundation for the diagnostic test system is now in place. The system is ready for the implementation of rendering and logic in the subsequent steps. The `data-module="diagnostic-test"` attribute is now functionally connected within the application's hydration pipeline.

### Step 2: Implement Core Structure and Block-Based Rendering (Completed)
- **Summary:** The rendering logic for the diagnostic test view has been fully implemented. The handler now reads test data and dynamically renders all blocks and questions onto a single page, preparing the ground for interactivity and state management.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Data Parsing:** The handler's constructor was updated to correctly parse the test configuration from the `#page-data` JSON island.
    2.  **Block-Based Layout:** A new `renderTest` method was implemented to loop through the blocks defined in the page data. It creates a distinct visual container for each block, including its title.
    3.  **Question Rendering Router:** A `renderQuestion` method was created to act as a router. It inspects the `type` of each question (`mc`, `input_correction`, etc.) and delegates to a specific rendering function.
    4.  **Specialized Renderers:** Crucially, this step involved creating several new question-rendering functions (`renderMultipleChoiceQuestion`, `renderInputCorrectionQuestion`, `renderInputRewriteQuestion`, `renderParagraphInputQuestion`). These were adapted from the `exercise-handler.js` but customized to handle the unique data structures and layout requirements of the diagnostic test, such as text areas for rewrite questions and multi-input paragraphs.
    5.  **Submission Button:** A "Submit Block" button was added to the end of each rendered block, as required by the plan.
- **Outcome:** The `DiagnosticTestHandler` is now capable of fully rendering a complex, multi-block diagnostic test from a JSON data source. The UI is structurally complete, though without user interactivity, which will be added in the next step.

### Step 3: Implement Visual Feedback and State Management (Completed)
- **Summary:** The core interactivity of the diagnostic test is now complete. The handler can now check answers, manage state for the entire test, and provide clear visual feedback to the user after a block is submitted. This step was implemented by tightly coupling the state, rendering, and event listeners.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **State Initialization:** An `initializeState` method was created to set up a comprehensive state object on the active tab. This object tracks the user's answer for every question and the submission status of each block.
    2.  **Live Answer-Saving:** Event listeners were added to all interactive elements (buttons, text areas, inputs). These listeners save the user's current answer to the state object in real-time using the `autoSave` function, ensuring no data is lost.
    3.  **Answer-Checking Logic:** A `checkAnswers` method was implemented. When a user submits a block, this method iterates through the saved answers, compares them against the correct answers from the page data, and updates the state with the results (`isCorrect`).
    4.  **Visual Feedback Implementation:** The rendering methods were significantly updated. They now read from the state object to apply CSS classes (`.btn-correct`, `.input-incorrect`, etc.) after a block is submitted, providing immediate visual feedback. The inputs are also disabled post-submission to prevent changes.
    5.  **CSS Verification:** Verified that all necessary CSS classes were already present in `src/style.css`, confirming the contingency plan to manually add CSS was not required for these specific features.
- **Outcome:** The diagnostic test is now a fully interactive component. Users can input answers, submit them block by block, and receive immediate, persistent feedback on their performance.


### Step 4: Implement Advanced Diagnostic Features (Completed)
- **Summary:** This step successfully added the final layer of functionality to the diagnostic test handler, making it a complete assessment tool. The handler now features a dynamic, data-driven diagnostics dashboard that updates in real-time as the user progresses through the test.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Added Chart.js Library:** The project was missing the Chart.js library. It was added via a CDN link in `src/index.html` as a pragmatic solution to avoid issues with the broken build system.
    2.  **Implemented Diagnostics Header:** A new UI component was created at the top of the test view. This `renderDiagnostics` method calculates and displays the user's overall score percentage and raw score, which updates after each block is submitted.
    3.  **Integrated Performance Chart:** A horizontal bar chart from Chart.js was integrated into the diagnostics header. A `renderOrUpdateChart` method was created to manage the chart's lifecycle, ensuring it is destroyed and redrawn correctly during UI updates. The chart visualizes the user's performance broken down by the `category` of each question.
    4.  **Implemented Final Review Mode:** The handler now detects when the final block has been submitted. It sets an `isComplete` flag in the state, which triggers a "review mode." In this mode, all inputs and buttons are disabled, and a "Test Complete" message is displayed, effectively making the test read-only for final review.
- **Outcome:** The `DiagnosticTestHandler` is now feature-complete as per the plan. It provides not only interactivity and basic feedback but also a sophisticated, real-time analysis of the user's performance, fulfilling the requirements for an advanced diagnostic tool.
