Hello! Here are the answers to your questions about the `DeprecationWarning`.

## What is the warning about?

The warning `(DEP0174) DeprecationWarning: Calling promisify on a function that returns a Promise is likely a mistake` means that somewhere in the application's code (or in one of its dependencies), the `util.promisify` function from Node.js is being used on a function that already returns a Promise.

The purpose of `util.promisify` is to convert a function that uses the traditional Node.js callback style (where the last argument is a callback like `(err, result) => ...`) into a function that returns a Promise.

When you call `promisify` on a function that *already* returns a Promise, it's redundant. The function will still work as expected, but it's an unnecessary step and often indicates a misunderstanding of how the function being called works.

## Should you be worried?

You shouldn't be overly worried in the short term, but it's something that should be fixed. Here's why:

1.  **It's a warning, not an error:** Your application will continue to run. This warning doesn't stop the execution.
2.  **Code quality and maintainability:** It indicates a code smell. Fixing it will make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier for other developers to understand.
3.  **Future-proofing:** Deprecation warnings are there for a reason. While this particular one might not break things in a future Node.js version (since it's more of a logical mistake), it's a good practice to address deprecation warnings as they appear. They often signal that a feature or pattern is being phased out.

**In summary:** It's not a critical, application-breaking issue right now. However, it's highly recommended to find the source of these warnings and remove the unnecessary `promisify` calls. This will improve your code quality and prevent potential issues down the line.

To find the source of the warning, you can run your application with the `--trace-deprecation` flag. For this project, you would modify the `start` script in your `package.json` or run it directly with node. For example:
`node --trace-deprecation .webpack/main`

This will give you a stack trace pointing to the exact locations in the code where the warning is being generated.
