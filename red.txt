# --- CRUCIAL INFORMATION ---
# This section contains crucial information. Do not delete from here.

- Task: Fix a large number of linting errors in multiple .js files.
- Visual Studio Code is showing a lot of errors.
- `red-lint.txt` contains a summary of the error types.


# --- CURRENT THOUGHT PROCESS ---
# This is a summary of my current thinking.
# I'll modify this as we proceed in addressing the current issues.

I have read `red-lint.txt` and have a list of the error types. 
Now I'm looking at the file structure to understand where the problematic files are. 
I see a `src` directory which likely contains the main application logic. 
I'll investigate that next.

> PLAN

Linting Refactor Plan

    Task 1: Configuration Fixes
        Address ESLint configuration errors like import/no-extraneous-dependencies, import/no-unresolved, and global-require.

    Task 2: Unused Variables
        Remove all unused variables (no-unused-vars) from the codebase.

    Task 3: Code Style (Part 1)
        Fix max-len and import/prefer-default-export errors.

    Task 4: Parameter Reassignment
        Refactor code to avoid reassigning function parameters (no-param-reassign).

    Task 5: Definition and Scope Issues
        Fix no-use-before-define and no-undef errors. This will involve tackling the complex files like renderer.js.

    Task 6: Code Style (Part 2)
        Address the remaining style errors (prefer-destructuring, no-plusplus, etc.).
