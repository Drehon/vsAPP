- Task: Fix a large number of linting errors in multiple .js files.
- Visual Studio Code is showing a lot of errors.
- `red-lint.txt` contains a summary of the error types.


# --- CURRENT THOUGHT PROCESS ---
# This is a summary of my current thinking.

I have read `red-lint.txt` and have a list of the error types. 
Now I'm looking at the file structure to understand where the problematic files are. 
I see a `src` directory which likely contains the main application logic. 
I'll investigate that next.
