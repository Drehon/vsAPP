app is currently working. 
but, in visual studio code, i get an enormous amount of errors for multiple files.
you can refer to red-lint.txt, which contains a summary of the error types, for more information.

inside red.txt we'll log all your thoughts, steps, etc regarding this issue, by progressively updating/appending information.

for this purpose, the txt has
1) static section where you write down all the crucial information, you can add to this area, but never delete stuff
2) modifiable area in which you explain the current though process, sort of a summary
3) appendable only area where you progressively log as we work, this is because i expect we'll use this txt for multiple tasks.

currently we must complete TASK 6 and only TASK 6 from the plan in red.txt

update red.txt at the end of each plan
verify code integrity, but do not attempt to actually run the app, instead ask me to do any testing if that is needed
