# VSAPP - Personal Learning Platform

This is a custom desktop application designed to host and manage interactive educational materials, primarily language lessons and exercises.

## About The Project

The goal is to create an autonomous, offline learning environment free from the limitations of standard web browsers. The application provides a unified interface to access various educational content, save progress, and interact with materials dynamically.

### Built With

* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Core Features

* **Dynamic Content Library:** The application launches to a central "Home" screen that acts as a dynamic library.
* **Advanced Save/Load System:** A non-destructive save system that creates versioned "snapshots" of user progress.
* **Full Interactivity:** Supports a wide range of interactive exercises, including multiple-choice, true/false, and written answers.
* **Offline-First and Self-Contained:** Designed to be fully functional offline.
* **Automatic Updates:** The application automatically checks for new versions and updates itself silently in the background.

## Getting Started

To get VSAPP up and running, choose the installation method that suits your needs.

### Installation for End-Users (Recommended)

The VSAPP installer provides a seamless experience, requiring no prior software installations (like Node.js or npm).

1. Download the latest installer from the [releases page](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name/releases).
2. Run the installer. The application will perform a **silent installation**, meaning it will install without requiring user interaction.
3. Upon successful installation, the application will be **immediately available on your desktop** via a shortcut.

### Installation for Developers

If you wish to contribute to VSAPP or run it from source, you will need Node.js and npm installed.

#### Prerequisites for Developers
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

#### Steps for Developers
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git)
   ```
2. Install NPM packages

## Automatic Updates

VSAPP includes an integrated auto-update feature to ensure you always have the latest version with new features and bug fixes.
* **Silent Background Updates:** The application periodically checks for updates in the background. When a new version is available, it downloads and installs it silently without interrupting your work.
* **Seamless Experience:** You do not need to manually download new installers or run updates. The process is fully automated, providing a seamless and up-to-date experience.
* **Restart for Activation:** Updates are applied upon the next launch of the application, or you may be prompted to restart to apply critical updates immediately.
