This file logs the completion of Step B4 of the ESLint v9 migration.

Summary of actions taken:
- Identified and resolved the `eslint-plugin-import` error by updating `eslint.config.js`.
- Addressed peer dependency conflicts by removing `eslint-config-airbnb-base`.
- Corrected ESLint parsing errors and warnings to achieve a clean linting process.

The ESLint configuration has been successfully updated as per the requirements of Step B4.

Issue: `npm run lint` was failing with a 'Cannot find module' error for the 'globals' package.

Resolution:
1. Modified `package.json` to include `"type": "module"`. This tells Node.js to treat .js files as ES modules, which is necessary for the new `eslint.config.js` format.
2. Deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and ran `npm install` to ensure a clean and correct installation of all dependencies.

The `npm run lint` command now runs successfully without errors.
