This file logs the completion of Step B4 of the ESLint v9 migration.

Summary of actions taken:
- Identified and resolved the `eslint-plugin-import` error by updating `eslint.config.js`.
- Addressed peer dependency conflicts by removing `eslint-config-airbnb-base`.
- Corrected ESLint parsing errors and warnings to achieve a clean linting process.

The ESLint configuration has been successfully updated as per the requirements of Step B4.

Issue: `npm run lint` was failing with a 'Cannot find module' error for the 'globals' package.

Resolution:
1. Modified `package.json` to include `"type": "module"`. This tells Node.js to treat .js files as ES modules, which is necessary for the new `eslint.config.js` format.
2. Deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and ran `npm install` to ensure a clean and correct installation of all dependencies.

The `npm run lint` command now runs successfully without errors.

### ESLint v9 Migration: Step 6 Verification

**Task**: Execute Step 6 of the ESLint v9 migration plan: "Verify the New Configuration".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies were correctly installed.
- Executed `npm run lint` to verify the new ESLint v9 configuration.
- The command completed successfully with a 0 exit code, indicating that there are no linting errors in the codebase.

**Conclusion**:
Step 6 of the ESLint v9 migration is complete. The new configuration is working as expected.

### ESLint v9 Migration: Step 7-1

**Task**: Execute Step 7-1 of the ESLint v9 migration plan: "Uninstall `eslint-plugin-node` and install `eslint-plugin-n`".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Uninstalled `eslint-plugin-node` using `npm uninstall eslint-plugin-node`.
- Installed `eslint-plugin-n` using `npm install eslint-plugin-n@latest --save-dev`.
- Verified that `package.json` was updated correctly.

**Conclusion**:
Step 7-1 of the ESLint v9 migration is complete.

### Phase 2: Strengthening ESLint Configuration

**Objective**: Enhance the ESLint configuration to enforce stricter code quality and consistency, similar to industry-standard style guides.

**1. Re-enable Stricter Rules:**
   - **Task**: Modify `eslint.config.js` to enable a curated set of rules that were previously disabled or are not part of `eslint:recommended`.
   - **Key Rules to Enable**:
     - `no-var`: Disallow the use of `var`.
     - `eqeqeq`: Require the use of `===` and `!==`.
     - `no-extra-semi`: Disallow unnecessary semicolons.
     - `quotes`: Enforce consistent use of single or double quotes.
     - `semi`: Require or disallow semicolons.
     - `indent`: Enforce consistent indentation.
     - `no-unused-vars`: Re-enable this to catch unused variables (currently 'off').
     - `no-console`: Re-enable this for production builds to avoid leaving logs.
   - **Rationale**: These rules are fundamental for modern JavaScript development and prevent common sources of bugs and inconsistencies.

**2. Investigate Airbnb Config Compatibility:**
   - **Task**: Research if `eslint-config-airbnb-base` has a version that is fully compatible with ESLint v9's flat config.
   - **If Compatible**: Create a plan to integrate the Airbnb config into `eslint.config.js`. This would be the most efficient way to adopt a comprehensive, high-quality ruleset.
   - **If Not Compatible**: Continue with the manual rule-by-rule enablement from Step 1, possibly using the Airbnb config as a reference for which rules to add.

**3. Incremental Codebase Cleanup:**
   - **Task**: After enabling new rules, run `npm run lint` to identify all the new errors across the codebase.
   - **Execution**: Create a separate task to fix all the reported linting errors. This should be done incrementally, possibly file by file or rule by rule, to manage the scope of changes.

**4. Final Verification:**
   - **Task**: Once all new rules are enabled and the codebase is clean (i.e., `npm run lint` passes), the process is complete. The project will now benefit from a much more robust static analysis setup.
