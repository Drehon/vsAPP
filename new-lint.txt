This file logs the completion of Step B4 of the ESLint v9 migration.

Summary of actions taken:
- Identified and resolved the `eslint-plugin-import` error by updating `eslint.config.js`.
- Addressed peer dependency conflicts by removing `eslint-config-airbnb-base`.
- Corrected ESLint parsing errors and warnings to achieve a clean linting process.

The ESLint configuration has been successfully updated as per the requirements of Step B4.

Issue: `npm run lint` was failing with a 'Cannot find module' error for the 'globals' package.

Resolution:
1. Modified `package.json` to include `"type": "module"`. This tells Node.js to treat .js files as ES modules, which is necessary for the new `eslint.config.js` format.
2. Deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and ran `npm install` to ensure a clean and correct installation of all dependencies.

The `npm run lint` command now runs successfully without errors.

### ESLint v9 Migration: Step 6 Verification

**Task**: Execute Step 6 of the ESLint v9 migration plan: "Verify the New Configuration".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies were correctly installed.
- Executed `npm run lint` to verify the new ESLint v9 configuration.
- The command completed successfully with a 0 exit code, indicating that there are no linting errors in the codebase.

**Conclusion**:
Step 6 of the ESLint v9 migration is complete. The new configuration is working as expected.

### ESLint v9 Migration: Step 7-1

**Task**: Execute Step 7-1 of the ESLint v9 migration plan: "Uninstall `eslint-plugin-node` and install `eslint-plugin-n`".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Uninstalled `eslint-plugin-node` using `npm uninstall eslint-plugin-node`.
- Installed `eslint-plugin-n` using `npm install eslint-plugin-n@latest --save-dev`.
- Verified that `package.json` was updated correctly.

**Conclusion**:
Step 7-1 of the ESLint v9 migration is complete.

### ESLint v9 Migration: Final Verification

**Task**: Verify the completion of all steps in the ESLint v9 migration plan.

**Summary of verification**:
- **Dependencies**: Verified that `package.json` has been updated with ESLint v9 and its compatible plugins (`@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-jest`, `eslint-plugin-import`, `globals`). `eslint-config-airbnb-base` was confirmed to be removed and `eslint-plugin-n` added, as per previous logs.
- **Configuration**: Verified that the new `eslint.config.js` file exists and is correctly formatted using the "flat" config structure.
- **Cleanup**: Confirmed that the old `.eslintrc.js` file has been deleted.
- **Scripts**: Verified that the `lint` and `lint:fix` scripts in `package.json` have been updated to remove the `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` flag.
- **Execution**:
    - `npm run lint` was executed successfully after running `npm install` to fix a dependency issue. The codebase is clean of any linting errors.
    - `npm test` was executed successfully, with all tests passing.

**Conclusion**:
All steps of the ESLint v9 migration plan have been successfully completed and verified. The project is now using the new ESLint v9 configuration.

### Analysis of `npm run start` Failure

**Issue:**
The `npm run start` command fails with the following error:
`Unable to find Electron app at C:\Users\User\Documents\TEFL Personal.webpack\main`

This error indicates a critical problem with how file paths are being resolved during the application's startup process. The path is malformed, missing a separator between the project directory (`TEFL Personal`) and the webpack output directory (`.webpack`).

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this issue is the `"type": "module"` setting in `package.json`. This line was added to enable support for ESLint v9's flat configuration file (`eslint.config.js`), which is an ES module.

However, this change forces Node.js to treat all `.js` files in the project as ES modules. The project's build configuration files, such as `forge.config.js`, rely on the `__dirname` global variable to construct file paths. `__dirname` is a feature of CommonJS modules and is not available in ES modules.

When `forge.config.js` is loaded as an ES module, `__dirname` becomes `undefined`. As a result, any path construction logic that uses `__dirname` (e.g., `path.join(__dirname, 'src/preload.js')`) fails, leading to the incorrect path seen in the error message.

**Proposed Solution:**
The most direct and least disruptive solution is to revert the project to a CommonJS-by-default environment while still allowing the ESLint configuration to be treated as an ES module.

This will be achieved by:
1.  **Removing `"type": "module"` from `package.json`**. This will restore CommonJS as the default module system for the project, ensuring that `__dirname` and other CommonJS features work as expected in the build scripts.
2.  **Renaming `eslint.config.js` to `eslint.config.mjs`**. The `.mjs` file extension explicitly tells Node.js to treat this specific file as an ES module, satisfying the requirement for ESLint's flat config without affecting the rest of the project.

This approach will resolve the `npm run start` error while preserving the new ESLint v9 configuration.

### Project: Strengthening ESLint Configuration - Step 1

**Task**: Complete Step 1 of the "Strengthening ESLint Configuration" project: "Re-enable Stricter Rules".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Modified `eslint.config.mjs` to enable a set of stricter, modern ESLint rules as outlined in `refine-lint.txt`.
- The following rules were added or updated:
  - `no-var`: 'error'
  - `eqeqeq`: ['error', 'always']
  - `no-extra-semi`: 'error'
  - `quotes`: ['warn', 'single']
  - `semi`: ['warn', 'always']
  - `indent`: ['warn', 2]
  - `no-unused-vars`: 'warn'
  - `no-console`: ['warn', { allow: ['warn', 'error'] }]
- Encountered and resolved a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for the `globals` package by running `npm install` to refresh dependencies.
- Verified the changes by running `npm run lint`, which now correctly reports violations for the newly enabled rules across the codebase.

**Conclusion**:
Step 1 of the ESLint strengthening project is complete. The configuration has been updated, and the new rules are active. The next step will be to address the new linting warnings and errors.

### Project: Strengthening ESLint Configuration - Step 2

**Task**: Complete Step 2 of the "Strengthening ESLint Configuration" project: "Investigate Airbnb Config Compatibility".

**Summary of actions taken**:
- Researched the compatibility of `eslint-config-airbnb-base` with ESLint v9 and its "flat config" format.
- The investigation confirmed that `eslint-config-airbnb-base` is not currently compatible. The related `eslint-config-airbnb-typescript` package is archived and no longer maintained, and there is no official support for the flat config structure.
- This confirms the findings from the previous ESLint v9 migration, where the package had to be removed.

**Conclusion**:
Step 2 of the ESLint strengthening project is complete. The investigation has concluded that installing the Airbnb config is not feasible. As per the project plan, the next phase of work should proceed with manually adding or enabling rules, using the Airbnb style guide as a reference.
