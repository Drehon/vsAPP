## Jules's Log for Patch Notes Automation

### Task Description
The user wants to automate the process of updating the application's patch notes. When the user clicks the "update" button, the application should:
1. Fetch the latest release information.
2. Update the `patchnotes.json` file with this information.
3. Regenerate the `patch-notes.html` file using the `scripts/update-patch-notes.js` logic.
4. Log all actions and reasoning in this file (`patchSOL.txt`).

### Plan Step 1: Modify `src/main.js`

**Actions Taken:**
- **Initial Analysis:** I identified that `src/main.js` contains the `electron-updater` logic, which is the core of the app's update mechanism. The key was to find the right place to inject the patch notes update logic. The user-initiated `start-download` event was the perfect trigger.
- **Problem with Read-Only Files:** I realized that when the application is packaged, files like `patchnotes.json` are stored in a read-only `asar` archive. This would prevent me from updating the file directly.
- **Solution - `userData` Directory:** To solve the read-only problem, I decided to manage the patch notes files in the `userData` directory, which is always writable.
    - On the first run, the application will copy the bundled `patchnotes.json` to the `userData` directory.
    - All subsequent updates will modify this writable copy.
- **Code Implementation:**
    1. **`updateInfo` variable:** Created a global variable to hold the release information received from the `update-available` event, so it could be used later when `start-download` is triggered.
    2. **`updateAndGeneratePatchNotes` function:** Created a new async function to encapsulate all the patch notes logic. This function:
        - Manages the `patchnotes.json` file in `userData`.
        - Adds the new release notes to it, checking for duplicates.
        - Re-implements the logic from `scripts/update-patch-notes.js` directly within the function to read the updated JSON, populate the HTML template, and write the final `patch-notes.html` to the `userData` directory. This avoids the complexity of spawning a separate script with correct file paths.
    3. **Modified `ipcMain.handle('get-file-content', ...)`:** Updated this handler to be aware of the new location for `patch-notes.html`. When the renderer process requests `others/patch-notes.html`, it's now served from the `userData` directory. It also handles the initial creation if the file doesn't exist yet.
    4. **Modified `autoUpdater` event listeners:**
        - The `update-available` listener now saves the received `info` object to the `updateInfo` variable.
        - The `start-download` listener now calls `updateAndGeneratePatchNotes(updateInfo)` and waits for it to complete *before* calling `autoUpdater.downloadUpdate()`.
    5. **Removed `get-patch-notes`:** The old IPC handler for getting patch notes was removed as its logic was integrated into the new `get-file-content` handler.

**Reasoning:**
This approach is robust because it doesn't rely on modifying the application's bundled files, which is not recommended and often impossible. By using the `userData` directory, I ensure that the patch notes can be updated dynamically, even in a packaged and installed application. The logic is centralized and triggered at the most logical point in the user flowâ€”right when they confirm they want to get the new update. This fulfills all the user's requirements in a clean and maintainable way.
