Function to be planned - bookmark
Add a bookmark that can be applied to any page via shortcut OR by right-click mouse menu
Bookmark should work similarly to save states, meaning there should be a file that keeps track of ALL BOOKMARKS
that automatically updates every time a bookmark is placed
and refreshes the bookmark on a page every time a page is opened or the user clicks on a different tab

Bookmarks should be recognizable but also visually pleasing.

Same reasoning as bookmark
User should be able to highlight portions of text
Save information in same file as bookmarks, we can call said file page-state
