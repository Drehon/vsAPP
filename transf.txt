This folder contains a Python script `transfer_releases.py` to transfer the latest release from the private `vsAPP` repository to the public `vsAPP-public` repository.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Install Python dependencies:** Install the required libraries using pip and the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**How to publish to the public repository:**

1.  **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
    *   Go to your GitHub settings: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
    *   Click on "Generate new token".
    *   Give the token a descriptive name.
    *   Under "Scopes", select the `repo` scope. This will grant the necessary permissions to read from your private repository and write to your public repository.
    *   Click "Generate token" and copy the token. **You will not be able to see it again.**

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `<your_github_token>` with the token you generated:
        ```
        GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>
        ```

3.  **Run the `publish-public` script:**
    *   Open a terminal in the project root.
    *   Run the following command:
        ```
        npm run publish-public
        ```

The script will then transfer the latest release and its assets from the `Drehon/vsAPP` repository to the `Drehon/vsAPP-public` repository.
