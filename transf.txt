This folder contains a Python script `transfer_releases.py` to transfer all releases from one GitHub repository to another.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **`PyGithub` library:** This script requires the `PyGithub` library. You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install PyGithub
    ```

**How to use the script:**

1.  **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
    *   Go to your GitHub settings: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
    *   Click on "Generate new token".
    *   Give the token a descriptive name.
    *   Under "Scopes", select the `repo` scope. This will grant the necessary permissions to read from your private repository and write to your public repository.
    *   Click "Generate token" and copy the token. **You will not be able to see it again.**

2.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as the `transfer_releases.py` script.
    *   Run the script with the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual data:

    ```
    python transfer_releases.py  https://github.com/Drehon/vsAPP-public https://github.com/Drehon/vsAPP
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```
    python transfer_releases.py ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Drehon/vsAPP Drehon/vsAPP-public
    ```

    *   `<your_github_token>`: The personal access token you  generated.
    *   `<source_repo_full_name>`: The full name of the source repository (e.g., `Drehon/vsAPP`).
    *   `<target_repo_full_name>`: The full name of the target repository (e.g., `Drehon/vsAPP-public`).

The script will then start transferring all the releases and their assets from the source repository to the target repository.
