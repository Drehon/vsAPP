This folder contains a Python script `transfer_releases.py` to transfer all releases from one GitHub repository to another.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Required libraries:** This script requires a few Python libraries. You can install them all at once by running this command in your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**How to use the script:**

1.  **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
    *   Go to your GitHub settings: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
    *   Click on "Generate new token".
    *   Give the token a descriptive name.
    *   Under "Scopes", select the `repo` scope. This will grant the necessary permissions to read from your private repository and write to your public repository.
    *   Click "Generate token" and copy the token. **You will not be able to see it again.**

2.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as the `transfer_releases.py` script.
    *   Run the script with the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual data. The script accepts both full GitHub URLs and the `owner/repository` format.

    **Command format:**
    ```
    python transfer_releases.py <your_github_token> <source_repo> <target_repo>
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```
    python transfer_releases.py ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Drehon/vsAPP Drehon/vsAPP-public
    ```

    *   `<your_github_token>`: The personal access token you generated.
    *   `<source_repo>`: The source repository. For this project, it's the private `Drehon/vsAPP`.
    *   `<target_repo>`: The target repository. For this project, it's the public `Drehon/vsAPP-public`.

The script will then start transferring all the releases and their assets from the source repository to the target repository.
