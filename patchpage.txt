Hypothesis for what was wrong:
The `patch-notes.html` file was attempting to load data using `window.api.getPatchNotes()`. This is a function exposed by Electron's preload script and is only available within the Electron application itself. When viewing the HTML file directly in a browser, `window.api` is not defined, which caused the script to fail and prevented the patch notes from being loaded.

Steps Taken:
1.  **Code Inspection:** I examined `others/patch-notes.html` and identified the use of `window.api.getPatchNotes()`.
2.  **Hypothesis Confirmation:** I reviewed `src/preload.js` and `src/main.js` to confirm that `getPatchNotes` is indeed part of the application's Electron-specific API, which fetches data from a remote URL or local files.
3.  **Implementation of Fix:** I modified `others/patch-notes.html` to use the standard `fetch()` API. The script now directly fetches `../patchnotes.json`, allowing it to work as a standalone file without relying on the Electron environment.

Possible Next Steps (if the implemented fix doesn't work):
*   **CORS Policy:** If the HTML file is ever hosted on a different domain than the JSON file, the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy would block the request. The server hosting the JSON file would need to be configured to allow requests from the HTML's domain.
*   **File Path:** If the directory structure changes, the relative path `../patchnotes.json` might become invalid, leading to a 404 error. The path would need to be updated.
*   **Invalid JSON:** If `patchnotes.json` contains syntax errors, the `response.json()` promise would reject. The JSON file would need to be corrected.
