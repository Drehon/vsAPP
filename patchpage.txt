### Final Diagnosis and Fix - 2025-08-01

#### Symptom
The patch notes page (`others/patch-notes.html`) remained blank when loaded within the Electron application, despite numerous attempts to fix logging and file access in the main process.

#### Investigation
A detailed review of the relevant files revealed a fundamental mismatch between the frontend code and the application's backend architecture:
1.  **`src/main.js` and `src/preload.js`**: These files contained a robust and carefully debugged system for fetching patch notes. The `get-patch-notes` IPC handler in `main.js` managed fetching from a GitHub API, caching results, and falling back to a local `patchnotes.json` file. This functionality was correctly exposed to the renderer process via `window.api.getPatchNotes()` in `preload.js`.
2.  **`others/patch-notes.html`**: The script inside this HTML file was *not* using the provided `window.api.getPatchNotes()` function. Instead, it was attempting to load the data using the standard browser `fetch()` API with a relative path (`fetch('../patchnotes.json')`).

#### Root Cause
The root cause of the failure was the incorrect use of `fetch()` within the Electron application's unique environment. When the HTML content from `patch-notes.html` is dynamically loaded into a tab, the base URI for resolving the relative path `'../patchnotes.json'` is not reliable. The fetch request was failing silently (from the user's perspective), and the page had no data to display. The application's purpose-built IPC bridge (`window.api`) was being completely ignored.

#### Solution
The definitive fix was to align the frontend with the backend architecture:
1.  **Modified `others/patch-notes.html`**: The script within the HTML file was completely replaced.
2.  **Correct API Call**: The new script now correctly calls `window.api.getPatchNotes()`.
3.  **Leveraged Existing Logic**: This change ensures that the page now uses the intended, robust data-fetching mechanism from the main process, including all its features like API calls, caching, fallbacks, and logging.

This solution resolves the issue by using the proper Electron IPC communication channel, which is designed to handle this exact type of interaction between a renderer process (the web page) and the main process (which has access to the file system and network resources).
