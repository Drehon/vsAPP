### Phase 2: Strengthening ESLint Configuration

**Objective**: Enhance the ESLint configuration to enforce stricter code quality and consistency, similar to industry-standard style guides.

**1. Re-enable Stricter Rules:**
   - **Task**: Modify `eslint.config.js` to enable a curated set of rules that were previously disabled or are not part of `eslint:recommended`.
   - **Key Rules to Enable**:
     - `no-var`: Disallow the use of `var`.
     - `eqeqeq`: Require the use of `===` and `!==`.
     - `no-extra-semi`: Disallow unnecessary semicolons.
     - `quotes`: Enforce consistent use of single or double quotes.
     - `semi`: Require or disallow semicolons.
     - `indent`: Enforce consistent indentation.
     - `no-unused-vars`: Re-enable this to catch unused variables (currently 'off').
     - `no-console`: Re-enable this for production builds to avoid leaving logs.
   - **Rationale**: These rules are fundamental for modern JavaScript development and prevent common sources of bugs and inconsistencies.

**2. Investigate Airbnb Config Compatibility:**
   - **Task**: Research if `eslint-config-airbnb-base` has a version that is fully compatible with ESLint v9's flat config.
   - **If Compatible**: Create a plan to integrate the Airbnb config into `eslint.config.js`. This would be the most efficient way to adopt a comprehensive, high-quality ruleset.
   - **If Not Compatible**: Continue with the manual rule-by-rule enablement from Step 1, possibly using the Airbnb config as a reference for which rules to add.

**3. Incremental Codebase Cleanup:**
   - **Task**: After enabling new rules, run `npm run lint` to identify all the new errors across the codebase.
   - **Execution**: Create a separate task to fix all the reported linting errors. This should be done incrementally, possibly file by file or rule by rule, to manage the scope of changes.

**4. Final Verification:**
   - **Task**: Once all new rules are enabled and the codebase is clean (i.e., `npm run lint` passes), the process is complete. The project will now benefit from a much more robust static analysis setup.
