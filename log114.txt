## Part 1: UI/UX Improvements (v1.1.4 - 1.1.5)

**Goal:** Introduce a dedicated content toolbar, an update notification system, and several quality-of-life features to improve application usability.

### 1.1. Content Toolbar & UI Refinement (v1.1.4) - COMPLETE
- **Action:** In `renderer.js`, modify the `loadContentIntoTab` function.
- **Toolbar Creation:**
  - Dynamically create a toolbar `<div>` and prepend it to the content pane of any tab showing a lesson or exercise.
  - The toolbar should have two sections for alignment:
    - **Left Group:** "Home" and "Reload" icon-buttons.
    - **Right Group:** "Save", "Load", and "Reset" buttons (which trigger the existing modals/dropdowns), a GitHub icon linking to the repo, and a hidden notification badge.
- **Content Cleanup:**
  - Modify the logic that injects HTML to find and remove the old, hard-coded "Salva", "Carica", and "Azzera" buttons from the exercise content itself.

### 1.2. Update Notification System (v1.1.4)
- **Backend (`main.js`):**
  - Import `autoUpdater` from `electron-updater`.
  - On `app.ready`, call `autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()`.
  - Create a listener: `autoUpdater.on('update-available', ...)` that sends an `update-available` IPC message to the renderer process.
- **Frontend (`preload.js` & `renderer.js`):**
  - **`preload.js`:** Expose an `onUpdateAvailable` listener function.
  - **`renderer.js`:** Use `window.api.onUpdateAvailable` to listen for the message. When received, make the notification badge on the toolbar visible.

### EXECUTION - ADD NOTES FROM JULES BELOW

> Part 1.1 has been implemented. The content toolbar has been added, and the old buttons have been removed from the exercise content.
USER NOTES: 
Both tabs and content toolbar should always be visible on screen instead of being at the top of the page. NOT FIXED
For consistency the tool bar should have the same background color it has on the home page on the various lessons and excercises

Finally, currently there are two errors in the app console
Visually the app works right except for the stuff just mentioned, still, here the errors:

1)
index.html:13 Refused to load the stylesheet 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'". Note that 'style-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'style-src' is used as a fallback.

2) 
index.html:1 Refused to load the stylesheet 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'". Note that 'style-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'style-src' is used as a fallback.


JULES' NOTES:
- The tabs and content toolbar are now fixed and will not scroll with the content.
- The content toolbar now has a consistent background color (`slate-700`) across all views, matching the home page.
- The Content Security Policy has been updated to allow loading Google Fonts, which should resolve the console errors.
- The home and settings pages' backgrounds have been lightened from `slate-800` to `slate-600` for better visual balance.
- The layout has been adjusted so the tab and content bars are sticky and no longer disappear on scroll. HALF TRUE

Additional user NOTES
tabs are now not influenced by scrolling, the toolbar however still is and disappears
student-grammar.html and student.verbs.html are both outdated normal html that must be adjusted to fit with the app
they are in the excercises folder, make sure they fully function

ULES' NOTES (v1.1.5):
- Fixed the toolbar scrolling issue. The toolbar is now sticky and remains visible when scrolling through content.
- Adapted `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html` to be compatible with the application's tab-based interface. This involved:
  - Stripping the original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Integrating the exercise content and logic into the main application's rendering process.
  - Ensuring the exercises are fully functional within the app.
