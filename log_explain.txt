## ISSUE 1 - FIRST RUN APPLICATION ERROR

I am currently fixing a race condition that occurs on the initial launch of the application. The renderer process, which is responsible for the user interface, is attempting to access Electron APIs before they are fully loaded, leading to errors.

To resolve this, I am implementing a signaling mechanism between the preload script and the renderer process.

1.  **`src/preload.js`:** I've added code to this file to dispatch a custom event called `api-ready` on the `window` object. This event is fired immediately after the `window.api` object is created, which exposes the necessary backend functionality to the frontend.

2.  **`src/renderer.js` (Next Step):** I will modify this file to wait for the `api-ready` event before executing any code that depends on `window.api`. This will ensure that the application initializes correctly every time, eliminating the race condition.

This approach ensures that the renderer process only attempts to use the APIs after they have been successfully exposed, making the application's startup process more robust and reliable.

## ISSUE 1 - FIX IMPLEMENTATION

I have now implemented the fix for the race condition.

1.  **`src/renderer.js`:** I've wrapped the entire application logic within the `api-ready` event listener. This ensures that all the code that depends on `window.api` is executed only after the API has been initialized in the preload script. This prevents any race conditions from occurring on startup.
