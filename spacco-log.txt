# Spacco Log: Task Report

## Task Objective

The primary objective of this task was to verify the past changes outlined in `spaccotto.txt` and address the issues listed in the "ISSUES AREA". The main issue was a WebSocket connection error (`WebSocket connection to 'ws://0.0.0.0:3000/ws' failed:`) when running `npm run start`, which prevented the application from loading.

## Investigation and Actions Taken (Previous Attempt)

My investigation led me to believe that the root cause of the WebSocket error was a misconfiguration in the build process, specifically related to the recent relocation of configuration files to a `settings` directory.

Here is a summary of the actions I took to diagnose and fix the issue:

1.  **Initial Investigation:** I started by reviewing `spaccotto.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `package.json`, and the various configuration files (`forge.config.js`, `webpack.*.js`, etc.) to understand the new project structure and build process.

2.  **Attempted Fix 1: `devServer` Configuration:** I identified that `settings/webpack.renderer.config.js` was missing a `devServer` configuration block. I added this block and set the `host` to `localhost` to address the WebSocket connection error.

3.  **Build Verification (`npm run package`):** To verify my changes, I attempted to package the application using `npm run package`. This command failed repeatedly with the error `The main entry point to your app was not found`. This indicated that the webpack build for the main process was not producing any output.

4.  **Debugging the Build Failure:** The rest of my time was spent debugging this build failure. I systematically tried the following solutions:
    *   **Correcting `CopyWebpackPlugin` paths:** I suspected that the paths in `webpack.main.config.js` were incorrect due to the file being moved. I corrected these paths, but the build still failed.
    *   **Testing Webpack Context:** I experimented with changing the `entry` path in `webpack.main.config.js` to test my assumptions about the webpack build context. This also failed.
    *   **Identifying the Root Cause:** I discovered that `electron-forge` was not loading the configuration from the `settings` directory at all. The `console.log` statements I added to the webpack config were never printed.
    *   **Attempted Fix 2: Pointing to the Config File:** I corrected this by adding a `config.forge` key to `package.json`, pointing to `./settings/forge.config.js`. This is the documented way to specify a custom config location. This also failed, but with a new error: `Cannot find module '/app/webpack.main.config.js'`.

## 2025-08-14: Successful Resolution

Picking up from the previous attempt, I identified two key issues:
1.  `electron-forge` was not being told where to find its configuration file.
2.  The paths inside `forge.config.js` were not robust, causing errors when the config was finally loaded.
3.  The `webpack-dev-server` was not configured to correctly inform the client which address to connect to for WebSockets.

Here are the successful steps taken to resolve the issue:

1.  **Corrected `package.json`**: I added the `config.forge` key to `package.json` to point `electron-forge` to the correct configuration file: `"config": { "forge": "./settings/forge.config.js" }`.

2.  **Fixed Configuration Paths**: I modified `settings/forge.config.js`. The paths to `webpack.main.config.js` and `webpack.renderer.config.js` were changed to use `path.join(__dirname, ...)` to create robust, absolute-like paths, resolving the `Cannot find module` error from the previous attempt.

3.  **Fixed WebSocket Connection**: I edited `settings/webpack.renderer.config.js`. I added a `client` object to the `devServer` configuration to explicitly set the WebSocket URL: `client: { webSocketURL: 'ws://localhost:3000/ws' }`. This forces the client-side code to connect to `localhost` instead of the unresolvable `0.0.0.0`.

4.  **Verification Result**: The user ran `npm run start`. The application now loads without the WebSocket error, meaning the build and dev server configurations are now working correctly. However, a new issue has appeared: the home page content does not load, leaving the page blank. The root cause of this new issue has not been investigated.
