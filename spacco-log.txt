# Spacco Log: Task Report

## Task Objective

The primary objective of this task was to verify the past changes outlined in `spaccotto.txt` and address the issues listed in the "ISSUES AREA". The main issue was a WebSocket connection error (`WebSocket connection to 'ws://0.0.0.0:3000/ws' failed:`) when running `npm run start`, which prevented the application from loading.

## Investigation and Actions Taken

My investigation led me to believe that the root cause of the WebSocket error was a misconfiguration in the build process, specifically related to the recent relocation of configuration files to a `settings` directory.

Here is a summary of the actions I took to diagnose and fix the issue:

1.  **Initial Investigation:** I started by reviewing `spaccotto.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `package.json`, and the various configuration files (`forge.config.js`, `webpack.*.js`, etc.) to understand the new project structure and build process.

2.  **Attempted Fix 1: `devServer` Configuration:** I identified that `settings/webpack.renderer.config.js` was missing a `devServer` configuration block. I added this block and set the `host` to `localhost` to address the WebSocket connection error.

3.  **Build Verification (`npm run package`):** To verify my changes, I attempted to package the application using `npm run package`. This command failed repeatedly with the error `The main entry point to your app was not found`. This indicated that the webpack build for the main process was not producing any output.

4.  **Debugging the Build Failure:** The rest of my time was spent debugging this build failure. I systematically tried the following solutions:
    *   **Correcting `CopyWebpackPlugin` paths:** I suspected that the paths in `webpack.main.config.js` were incorrect due to the file being moved. I corrected these paths, but the build still failed.
    *   **Testing Webpack Context:** I experimented with changing the `entry` path in `webpack.main.config.js` to test my assumptions about the webpack build context. This also failed.
    *   **Identifying the Root Cause:** I discovered that `electron-forge` was not loading the configuration from the `settings` directory at all. The `console.log` statements I added to the webpack config were never printed.
    *   **Attempted Fix 2: Pointing to the Config File:** I corrected this by adding a `config.forge` key to `package.json`, pointing to `./settings/forge.config.js`. This is the documented way to specify a custom config location. This also failed, but with a new error: `Cannot find module '/app/webpack.main.config.js'`.
