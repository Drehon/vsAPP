update doesn't reference the public repository from 1.3.9 to 1.4.0
this mean we need to FIRST fix 1.3.9
then publish 1.4.0 too
test 1.3.9 update to 1.4.0 publishing only to public
and start over if it fails

  {
    "body": "Small tweaks. Complete shift to public repository. Adjustements to the publish process needed.",
