[Jules's work log]

Thoughts: The user wants the load and save buttons in the toolbar to work for the test pages (`student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html`). The previous attempt to fix this by using a generic initializer failed because the test pages use a different, more complex data structure (`testData` object) than the regular exercises (`fase1`, `fase2`, etc.).

Hypothesis: The correct approach is to route the test pages to their specialized initialization scripts (`initializeGrammarExercise` and `initializeVerbsExercise`) and then add the necessary save/load functionality directly into those scripts, making them compatible with the toolbar buttons.

Final Plan:
1. *Restore the correct exercise initializers in `content-loader.js`.*
   - Modify `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call `initializeGrammarExercise` for `student-grammar.html` and `initializeVerbsExercise` for `student-verbs.html`.
2. *Implement save/load functionality in the specialized initializers.*
   - Add event listeners for the toolbar's save and load buttons to `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - The save button will trigger a file save dialog with the current exercise state.
   - The load button will open a file picker, and upon selection, will parse the JSON file, update the state, and re-render the test.
3. *Update this file (`loadtest.txt`).*
   - Document the process for future reference.

Steps Taken:
- Investigated the codebase, including `content-loader.js`, `exercise-initializer.js`, `grammar-exercise.js`, `verb-exercise.js`, and the HTML of the test pages.
- Confirmed the data structure mismatch and the lack of save/load event handlers in the specialized scripts.
- Modified `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call the correct initializer for each test page.
- Added the save and load logic to both `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`, connecting them to the toolbar buttons.
- Updated this log file.

Next Steps:
- Submit the changes for the user to test.

[Original User Notes for reference]
USER NOTES
REVERTED
VM270:65 Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Bad escaped character in JSON at position 24381 (line 65 column 302)
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at initializeExercise (exercise-initializer.js:5:1)
    at loadContentIntoTab (content-loader.js:87:35)

I'm unsure we are on the same page.
I wish for the two tests to function in the same way as excercise pages
Meaning i want to be able to save/load the jsons with the buttons in the toolbar

USER NOTES 2

the load/test buttons now work
but on load i get this
grammar-exercise.js:736 Error loading JSON: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at reader.onload (grammar-exercise.js:713:1)

Also, on submit for grammer we get
grammar-exercise.js:420 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'A1_part0')
    at eval (grammar-exercise.js:420:1)
    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)

    at HTMLButtonElement.handleBlockSubmit (grammar-exercise.js:231:1)


Whereas on submit for verbs, the input is not displayed after submit for comparison
and under every question the correct answer is displayed in green with Correct
