Work Summary: Fixed an issue on the Grammar test page where answers were not being saved by the auto-save ("save-state") mechanism.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
The user reported that answers on the grammar test page were not being saved, while notes were. This issue was already fixed for the verb test page. My hypothesis was that the `grammar-exercise.js` script was missing the same logic that had been added to `verb-exercise.js`. Specifically, it lacked an `addAnswerListeners` function to save answers on input, and a `loadAnswers` function to populate the fields on render.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1. *Implement `addAnswerListeners` in `grammar-exercise.js`:*
   - **Action:** Created a new function, `addAnswerListeners`, modeled directly on the one from `verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** This function attaches an `input` event listener to all answer fields. The listener updates the `testState` object with the user's answer and calls `saveExerciseState` to persist it.
2. *Implement `loadAnswers` in `grammar-exercise.js`:*
   - **Action:** Created a new function, `loadAnswers`, also based on the verb exercise script.
   - **Details:** This function reads the `testState` for the current block and populates the answer fields with any saved data.
3. *Integrate Functions into `renderQuestions`:*
   - **Action:** Modified the `renderQuestions` function in `grammar-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** Added calls to `loadAnswers()` and `addAnswerListeners()` to ensure the save/load logic executes whenever a test block is displayed.
   - **Outcome:** This brings the grammar page's functionality in line with the verb page's, resolving the bug. Answers are now saved on-the-fly and reloaded correctly.

Next Steps:
- The fix is complete. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review and testing.

Work Summary: Fixed an issue on the Verbs test page where saved answers were not displayed upon reload.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
The user reported that on the Verbs test page, answers were not being saved by the auto-save ("save-state") mechanism, even though notes were working correctly. A previous fix had implemented the saving logic (`addAnswerListeners`), but the issue persisted.

My hypothesis was that the problem wasn't in the saving, but in the loading. The code was saving the answers to the state object correctly, but it was missing a crucial function to load those answers back into the form fields when the page was rendered. The `loadNotes` function existed, but no corresponding `loadAnswers` function did, which perfectly explained the observed behavior.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1. *Implement `loadAnswers` function:*
   - **Action:** Created a new function, `loadAnswers`, in `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** This function is designed to mirror the `loadNotes` function. It reads the `testState` object for the current test block, iterates through any saved answers, finds the corresponding form elements by name, and sets their `value`.
2. *Call `loadAnswers` on Render:*
   - **Action:** Modified the `renderQuestions` function in `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** I added a call to the new `loadAnswers()` function immediately after the notes are loaded and before the event listeners are attached.
   - **Outcome:** This ensures that whenever a test block is displayed (on initial load, tab switch, or after loading a file), the user's previously saved answers are correctly populated into the input fields. This resolves the bug.

Next Steps:
- The fix is complete. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review and testing.

Work Summary: Fixed a recurring crash on the Grammar test page.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
The user reported that the grammar page was crashing on load, which prevented any interaction. The error was a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`, identical to a previously "fixed" bug.
My hypothesis was that the crash occurred when loading a saved exercise state that did not include a `notes` object. The `enterReviewMode` function, which is called on load if the test block is already completed, was attempting to access `tab.exerciseState.notes` without first verifying its existence. When this property was `undefined` (as it would be in older save files or certain edge cases), the application would crash.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1. *Fix Grammar Page Crash:*
    - **Action:** Modified `enterReviewMode` in `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js`.
    - **Details:** I added a guard condition (`&& tab.exerciseState.notes`) to the `if` statements that access the `notes` object for both paragraph-style and regular questions. This ensures the code only attempts to load notes if the `notes` object actually exists in the current exercise state.
    - **Outcome:** This change makes the loading process more robust by preventing the `TypeError`. The grammar page should now load correctly even when using older save files that lack the `notes` data structure.

Next Steps:
- The primary bug has been addressed. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review.

Work Summary: Fixed a crash on the Grammar test page, a review-mode bug on the Verbs test page, and implemented on-the-fly answer saving for the Verbs test page.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
Based on the user's notes, I identified three distinct issues:
1.  **Grammar Page Crash:** The page was unusable due to a `TypeError`. I hypothesized that the `enterReviewMode` function was being called with invalid data (a completed block with no `answers` object) during the initial load, causing a crash when trying to access the `answers`.
2.  **Verbs Page Review Bug:** In review mode, the "Correct: ..." feedback was showing for all answers, even correct ones. I hypothesized that the logic to display this feedback was not correctly scoped and was executing unconditionally for certain question types.
3.  **Verbs Page Answer Saving:** The user noted that answers were not being saved by the auto-save ("save-state") mechanism. I hypothesized that unlike the notes fields, the answer input fields lacked the necessary event listeners to trigger a save on every change.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1.  *Fix Verbs Page Review Mode Bug:*
    - **Action:** Modified `enterReviewMode` in `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
    - **Details:** I moved the creation of the feedback container (which shows the correct answer) entirely inside the `if (!isCorrect)` block for the `paragraph_error_id` question type.
    - **Outcome:** This ensures the "Correct: ..." feedback only appears for incorrect answers, as intended.

2.  *Fix Grammar Page Crash:*
    - **Action:** Modified `renderQuestions` in `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js`.
    - **Details:** I added a guard condition to the `enterReviewMode` call, changing `if (testState[block].completed)` to `if (testState[block].completed && testState[block].answers)`.
    - **Outcome:** This prevents the function from executing with incomplete state, resolving the `TypeError` and making the page functional again.

3.  *Implement On-the-fly Answer Saving for Verbs Page:*
    - **Action:** Added a new `addAnswerListeners` function to `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
    - **Details:** This function attaches an `input` event listener to every answer field (`input`, `select`, `textarea`). On input, the listener updates the `testState` object and. Calls `saveExerciseState` to persist the changes immediately.
    - **Outcome:** Answers on the Verbs page are now saved automatically as the user types, consistent with the behavior of the notes fields.

Next Steps:
- All planned fixes are complete. The test pages should now be stable and all save/load/review functionality should work as expected. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review and testing.

Work Summary: Addressed multiple critical bugs preventing the save/load functionality from working on the grammar and verb test pages. Also fixed a review-mode bug on the verb test page.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
The user reported a cascade of errors: saving produced empty files, loading these files caused crashes (`SyntaxError` or `TypeError`), and the verb test's review mode was not functioning correctly.

My initial hypotheses were:
1. The loading crashes were a direct result of trying to parse empty or malformed save files. The auto-loading mechanism lacked validation.
2. The empty save files were caused by a fundamental bug in how the save data was being passed from the renderer process to the main process for writing to disk.
3. The verb test review bug was a separate, minor issue related to case-sensitive string comparison.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1. *Make Auto-Loading More Robust:*
   - **Action:** I modified `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`.
   - **Details:** I added a validation block to check the structure of the `savedState` object loaded by `window.api.loadExerciseState`. If the loaded data is corrupt or missing required keys, the exercise now starts fresh instead of crashing. This immediately stabilized the application and fixed the `TypeError` on load.

2. *Fix the Verb Test Review Mode Bug:*
   - **Action:** I modified the `enterReviewMode` function in `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** I changed a case-sensitive comparison (`userAnswer === part.answer.toLowerCase()`) to be case-insensitive (`userAnswer.toLowerCase() === part.answer.toLowerCase()`).
   - **Outcome:** This ensures that answers are graded correctly regardless of capitalization, fixing the issue where correct answers were being marked as wrong.

3. *Fix the Empty Save File Issue:*
   - **Action:** I corrected the `window.api.showSaveDialogAndSaveFile` call in both `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** I discovered the root cause of the saving problem was a mismatch in the IPC call signature. The renderer was passing two arguments (`filename`, `data`), while the main process expected a single object (`{ defaultFilename, data }`). This caused the `data` to be `undefined` in the main process, resulting in an empty file being written. I changed the call to pass a single object, e.g., `showSaveDialogAndSaveFile({ defaultFilename: ..., data: ... })`.
   - **Outcome:** This fixes the core bug. The manual save buttons now correctly save the test progress as a populated JSON file. Loading these files now works as intended.

Next Steps:
- All planned fixes are complete. The application should now be stable, and the save/load functionality for test pages should be fully operational. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review and testing.

Work Summary: Addressed several bugs related to the save/load functionality and submission process for the grammar and verb test pages.

Thoughts & Hypothesis:
The user reported several issues stemming from a previous attempt to integrate the toolbar's save/load buttons with the test pages. My hypothesis was that these bugs were caused by two main problems:
1. A fragile file loading mechanism that crashed when given empty or invalid files, leading to a corrupted application state.
2. Incorrect handling of user answers in the verb test script, which caused display issues after submission.

Plan & Steps Taken:
1. *Make JSON Loading Robust:*
   - **Action:** I modified the `fileInput.onchange` event handler in both `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** The new code first checks if the loaded file is empty. If not, it parses the JSON and then runs a validation check to ensure the parsed object has the correct structure (e.g., contains keys '1', '2', '3', and each of those has 'completed' and 'answers' properties).
   - **Outcome:** This prevents the `Unexpected end of JSON input` error and ensures that the application state is only updated with valid data, which also prevents the downstream `TypeError` on grammar test submission.

2. *Fix Answer Handling in Verb Test:*
   - **Action:** I modified the `handleBlockSubmit` function in `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - **Details:** I removed the `.toLowerCase()` call that was being applied to user answers before they were stored. The original casing is now preserved. The comparison logic in `enterReviewMode` was already case-insensitive, so it continues to function correctly.
   - **Outcome:** This ensures that the user's actual input is displayed in review mode, fixing both the "input not displayed" and the "correct answer always shown" bugs.

3. *Address Grammar Test Submission Error:*
   - **Action:** No direct code change was needed for this step.
   - **Details:** My analysis confirmed the `TypeError` was a symptom of the faulty loading mechanism. By fixing the loading process in step 1, the root cause of this error was eliminated.

Next Steps:
- The fixes are complete. The next step is to submit the changes for the user's review and testing.

[Previous work log]

Thoughts: The user wants the load and save buttons in the toolbar to work for the test pages (`student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html`). The previous attempt to fix this by using a generic initializer failed because the test pages use a different, more complex data structure (`testData` object) than the regular exercises (`fase1`, `fase2`, etc.).

Hypothesis: The correct approach is to route the test pages to their specialized initialization scripts (`initializeGrammarExercise` and `initializeVerbsExercise`) and then add the necessary save/load functionality directly into those scripts, making them compatible with the toolbar buttons.

Final Plan:
1. *Restore the correct exercise initializers in `content-loader.js`.*
   - Modify `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call `initializeGrammarExercise` for `student-grammar.html` and `initializeVerbsExercise` for `student-verbs.html`.
2. *Implement save/load functionality in the specialized initializers.*
   - Add event listeners for the toolbar's save and load buttons to `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`.
   - The save button will trigger a file save dialog with the current exercise state.
   - The load button will open a file picker, and upon selection, will parse the JSON file, update the state, and re-render the test.
3. *Update this file (`loadtest.txt`).*
   - Document the process for future reference.

Steps Taken:
- Investigated the codebase, including `content-loader.js`, `exercise-initializer.js`, `grammar-exercise.js`, `verb-exercise.js`, and the HTML of the test pages.
- Confirmed the data structure mismatch and the lack of save/load event handlers in the specialized scripts.
- Modified `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call the correct initializer for each test page.
- Added the save and load logic to both `src/sub-functions/grammar-exercise.js` and `src/sub-functions/verb-exercise.js`, connecting them to the toolbar buttons.
- Updated this log file.

Next Steps:
- Submit the changes for the user to test.
