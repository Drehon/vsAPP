Thoughts: The load and save buttons are not working on the test pages. This is likely because the test pages are using a different exercise initialization function than the other pages.

Hypothesis: The `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html` pages are using their own specific initialization functions (`initializeGrammarExercise` and `initializeVerbsExercise`) which have incomplete or incorrect save/load implementations.

Plan:
1. Modify `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call the generic `initializeExercise` function for `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html`. This function has the correct save and load functionality.
2. Create a `loadtest.txt` file to document the process.

Steps Taken:
1. Modified `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js` to call `initializeExercise` for `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html`.

Next Steps:
- Verify that the save and load buttons now work correctly on the test pages.
- Submit the changes.

I'm unsure we are on the same page.
I wish for the two tests to function in the same way as excercise pages
Meaning i want to be able to save/load the jsons with the buttons in the toolbar
