    Log file created.

2024-07-28 15:48 CEST - 16:15 CEST:

    Resolved build and versioning issues by correcting forge.config.js.

2024-07-28 16:20 CEST:

    Issue #1 (Version Mismatch) - RESOLVED.

    Issue #3 ("Save" Button Crash) - RESOLVED.

    Began diagnosis of Issue #2 ("Update failed").

2024-07-28 16:25 CEST:

    User reported the update check is now stuck on "Checking for updates..." instead of failing.

    Analyzed console logs, which showed no errors.

    Hypothesized the issue is a network timeout due to GitHub API rate-limiting on the unauthenticated installed app.

2024-07-28 16:13 CEST:

    User requested a new empty canvas. A new canvas with ID empty_canvas_1 has been created.

2024-07-28 16:16 CEST:

    User provided diagnostic.txt and clarified update behavior: "Update failed" on startup, "Checking for updates..." after reload.

    Opened src/main.js to investigate auto-updater initialization and event handling.

2024-07-28 16:17 CEST:

    Modified src/main.js to uncomment mainWindow.webContents.send calls for auto-updater events. This will ensure update status messages are sent to the renderer process for clearer diagnosis.

    Declared mainWindow globally to ensure it's accessible within the autoUpdater event handlers.

2024-07-28 16:18 CEST:

    User provided a network tab screenshot showing successful index.html and index.js loads.

    Noted that the screenshot does not show autoUpdater network requests, which is expected as those happen later.

    Reaffirmed the need for the user to apply the src/main.js changes and report console output for update_status messages.

2024-07-28 16:20 CEST:

    Reapplied the same modifications to src/main.js based on the latest main_js_original provided by the user, ensuring mainWindow is globally defined and webContents.send calls for auto-updater events are active.

2024-07-28 16:22 CEST:

    User stated "nothing changed" and provided an identical network tab screenshot, indicating the previous main.js changes were not yet applied to the installed application.

    Reiterated the need for the user to rebuild and reinstall the application to see the effects of the main.js modifications in the console.

2024-07-28 16:25 CEST:

    User confirmed they have followed the instructions.

    Requested console output from the installed application to diagnose auto-updater behavior.

2024-07-28 16:28 CEST:

    User provided a screenshot of the renderer console, which showed no update-status messages.

    Identified that the issue is likely in the main process or IPC communication.

    Requested the user to switch the Developer Tools console to the "main" process and provide its output for further diagnosis.

2024-07-28 16:30 CEST:

    User provided a screenshot indicating they are still viewing the "top" (renderer) console.

    Clarified the instruction to switch the Developer Tools console to the "main" process.

2024-07-28 16:32 CEST:

    User indicated "there's only top" in the console dropdown.

    Modified src/main.js to uncomment mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools(); and added a console.log in createWindow to force DevTools to open and capture main process logs.

2024-07-28 16:35 CEST:

    User provided screenshots showing the "top" console and network tab, still without main process logs or update requests.

    Implemented file-based logging in src/main.js to capture main process console output to main-process-log.txt as a fallback.

    Provided instructions to rebuild, install, run, and then retrieve the content of main-process-log.txt.

2024-07-28 16:38 CEST:

    User provided the content of main-process-log.txt, which clearly shows ENOENT error for app-update.yml and GITHUB_TOKEN not found warning.

    Identified the root cause as app-update.yml missing from the production build due to incorrect publisher-github configuration in forge.config.js.

    Explained the role of GITHUB_TOKEN vs. app-update.yml.

    Modified forge.config.js to add comments emphasizing the need to replace placeholder owner and name values in the publisher-github configuration.

2024-07-28 16:40 CEST:

    User requested to update the forge.config.js immersive with the content they provided.

    Updated the forge_config_js_original immersive with the latest content, including owner: 'Drehon' and name: 'vsAPP' in the publisher-github configuration, and the postMake hook.

2024-07-28 16:45 CEST:

    User provided new logs, still showing ENOENT for app-update.yml.

    Explained that the postMake hook might be conflicting with automatic app-update.yml generation.

    Modified forge.config.js to remove the hooks section entirely, relying solely on publisher-github to generate app-update.yml.

2024-07-28 16:47 CEST:

    User expressed confusion about removing the hooks section, referencing previous issues, but agreed to try the new code.

    Reaffirmed the rationale for removing the hook to isolate app-update.yml generation to publisher-github.

    Confirmed readiness to revert if necessary.

2024-07-28 16:50 CEST:

    User confirmed that removing the hooks section did not resolve the ENOENT error for app-update.yml and requested to revert.

    Reverted forge.config.js to the version that includes the postMake hook and the correct publisher-github configuration to ensure latest.yml is generated.

2024-07-28 16:55 CEST:

    User stated that the forge.config.js code provided in the previous step (with extraResource for latest.yml) was already tested and did not work.

    Identified a new error in the provided terminal log: Could not find module with name: @electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-natives.

    Explained that this plugin is missing from devDependencies in package.json.

    Updated package.json to include @electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-natives in devDependencies.

    Instructed the user to update package.json, run npm install, then rebuild and test.

    Noted the user's decision to leave branch 211b and move to 211c in the log.

2024-07-28 16:58 CEST:

    User requested to modify the package.json in the canvas.

    Identified a typo in the plugin name "@electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-native-modules" in the provided package.json immersive.

    Corrected the plugin name to "@electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-natives" in the package_json_updated immersive.

    Provided instructions to update package.json, run npm install, then rebuild and test.

    Noted the user's decision to leave branch 211b and move to 211c in the log.

2024-07-28 17:00 CEST:

    User asked about the repeated "initializing main window" and "token not found" messages in the log.

    Explained that this indicates multiple window creations due to app.on('ready') and app.on('activate') firing in quick succession.

    Modified src/main.js to add an isMainWindowCreated flag to ensure createWindow() is called only once.

    Provided instructions to update src/main.js, rebuild, install, and provide the new main-process-log.txt.

    Noted the user's decision to leave branch 211b and move to 211c in the log.

2024-07-28 17:03 CEST:

    User provided new logs from branch 211c, confirming multiple window creations, persistent ENOENT for app-update.yml, and a new get-app-version handler error.

    Acknowledged the user's concerns about reintroducing bugs and their branch change.

    Modified src/main.js to fix the multiple window creation logic and address the get-app-version IPC handler error.

2024-07-28 17:13 CEST:

    User requested a plan to finish the app, confirm update implementation, and check relevant files.

    Outlined a 5-step plan focusing on autoUpdater implementation, file examination, and specific error resolution.

    Confirmed autoUpdater is implemented but not fully functional.

    Listed src/main.js, forge.config.js, package.json, src/preload.js, and src/renderer.js as relevant files.

    Next step: Open src/main.js to verify autoUpdater and fix the get-app-version error.

2024-07-28 17:15 CEST:

    Reviewed src/main.js.

    Identified redundant ipcMain.on('app_version') and refined createWindow logic.

    Provided main_js_updated with these changes.

    Instructed user to update src/main.js, rebuild, reinstall, and provide new main-process-log.txt and console output.

2024-07-28 17:21 CEST:

    User stated previous main_js_updated was "slightly off".

    Re-analyzed main_js_updated and confirmed ipcMain.on('app_version') was still present.

    Corrected main_js_updated to remove ipcMain.on('app_version').

    Next file to check: src/preload.js.

2024-07-28 17:24 CEST:

    Acknowledged user's correction to check all files first.

    Opened src/preload.js for review.

2024-07-28 17:27 CEST:

    Analyzed src/preload.js.

    Concluded that it is correctly configured for IPC communication, including auto-updater and getAppVersion.

    No modifications are needed in this file at this time.

2024-07-28 17:30 CEST:

    Opened src/renderer.js for review.

2024-07-28 17:33 CEST:

    Analyzed src/renderer.js.

    Concluded that it is well-structured and correctly implements the client-side UI logic for updates, network status, and app version display.

    No modifications are needed in this file at this time.

2024-07-28 17:36 CEST:

    Opened package.json for review.

2024-07-28 17:39 CEST:

    Analyzed package.json.

    Concluded that it is mostly well-configured, but noted the incorrect plugin name @electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-native-modules in devDependencies, which should be @electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-natives.

2024-07-28 17:42 CEST:

    Opened forge.config.js for review. This is the last file in the identified list of relevant files.

2024-07-28 17:45 CEST:

    Analyzed forge.config.js.

    Concluded that it is mostly correctly set up for packaging and publishing.

    The hooks.postMake section, which manually generates and attaches latest.yml, is the primary area of concern. It might be redundant or conflict with electron-updater's default behavior, especially regarding the ENOENT error for app-update.yml (which is distinct from latest.yml or dev-app-update.yml).

2024-07-28 17:48 CEST:

    Acknowledged user's reminder about the postMake hook and its purpose.

    Provided an overall plan and hypothesis for the next steps, focusing on applying identified fixes, addressing GITHUB_TOKEN, and re-evaluating dev-app-update.yml generation based on logs.

    The immediate next step is to correct the typo in package.json.

2024-07-28 17:52 CEST:

    User clarified that the repository is public and the GITHUB_TOKEN is for development only, meaning the installed app should not require authentication for updates.

    This refines the understanding of the GITHUB_TOKEN not found warning as a development-only concern, shifting focus back to the ENOENT for app-update.yml as the primary blocking issue for updates.

    Proceeding with correcting the package.json typo as the next step.

2024-07-28 17:55 CEST:

    User provided new error logs: Cannot find module 'copy-webpack-plugin'.

    Identified the need to add copy-webpack-plugin to devDependencies in package.json.

    Provided package_json_updated with the added dependency.

    Instructed user to update package.json, run npm install, then rebuild, reinstall, and provide new main-process-log.txt and console output.

2024-07-28 18:00 CEST:

    User provided new logs after applying package.json changes.

    Analyzed the new logs, noting the persistence of repeated createWindow calls, GITHUB_TOKEN warnings, ENOENT for app-update.yml, and the reappearance of No handler registered for 'get-app-version'.

    The immediate next step is to re-examine src/main.js to ensure the previous fixes are correctly applied and not being bypassed.
