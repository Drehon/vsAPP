Jules' Audit Log - July 28, 2025

I have taken the following actions to resolve the publishing issue:

1.  **Analyzed the `audit_work.txt` file:** I reviewed the extensive troubleshooting history to understand the context of the problem. The core issue was identified as a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for `scripts/publish-helper.js` when running `npm run publish`.

2.  **Inspected project configuration:** I examined `package.json`, `forge.config.js`, and the scripts within the `scripts` directory.

3.  **Simplified the `publish` script:** The `publish` script in `package.json` was overly complex and used a `node -e` command that was failing to resolve the script path correctly. I simplified this to a direct call: `node scripts/publish-helper.js`. This is a more standard and robust way to execute a local script.

My reasoning is that the previous approach was unnecessarily complex and prone to errors, especially in a Windows environment. By simplifying the script, we rely on Node's standard module resolution, which should correctly locate and execute the `publish-helper.js` script.

**Next Steps & Recommendations for the User:**

*   **Run the publish command:** You should now be able to run `npm run publish` from your terminal. Please ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of your project with a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   If the command fails, please provide me with the full error output.
    *   Ensure that you have run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
    *   If you continue to experience issues, the recommendation from the previous audit to perform a clean reinstallation of Node.js and npm remains a valid, albeit more drastic, solution.

This change should resolve the immediate issue and allow you to publish your application.
