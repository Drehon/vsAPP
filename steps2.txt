ORIGINAL REQUEST

Azzera Button: 
The reset button should clear the save-state (reset answers, empty notes) without reloading the page or changing the current phase (e.g., stay in phase 2). 
It should however also give some kind of visual feedback. 
Perhaps in the toolbar we can add besides the reset button a new area, where we can display text 'Reset Complete' to fade over 5 seconds or so.

---

Implemented the Azzera (Reset) button functionality with visual feedback.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Modified `src/index.html`:**
    *   Added a `<span>` element with the ID `reset-feedback-message` next to the "Azzera" button (`global-reset-btn`).
    *   This span is used to display the "Reset Complete" message.
    *   It is initially hidden using Tailwind CSS classes (`opacity-0`).

2.  **Updated `src/renderer.js`:**
    *   Added a constant `resetFeedbackMessage` to get the new `span` element from the DOM.
    *   Modified the `onclick` event handler for the `global-reset-btn`.
    *   The new handler now performs the following actions:
        - Calls the `window.api.resetExerciseState` function as before.
        - Immediately reloads the tab's content using `handleLoadContent` to reflect the cleared state.
        - If the reset was successful, it updates the `reset-feedback-message` span:
            - Sets its text to "Reset Complete".
            - Makes it visible by removing the `opacity-0` class.
            - Uses `setTimeout` to hide the message again after 5 seconds by re-adding the `opacity-0` class.
            - A nested `setTimeout` clears the text content after the fade-out transition completes.

---

User request:
i'd like the reset complete to have its own static space instead of appearing and moving things to the left. 
the text is the thing that has to appear and disappear, but its space should remain static and have a slighly darker background to differentiate it from the rest of the toolbar

Implemented the Azzera (Reset) button functionality with visual feedback, ensuring the feedback area has a static size to prevent layout shifts.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Modified `src/index.html`:**
    *   Replaced the original feedback `<span>` with a `<div>` container to create a static, reserved space in the toolbar.
    *   This `div` is styled with a fixed width (`w-32`), a height matching the toolbar buttons (`h-8`), and a slightly darker background (`bg-slate-600`) to differentiate it.
    *   Inside this container, a new `<span>` with the ID `reset-feedback-message` was added. This inner span is responsible for displaying the text.

2.  **Verified `src/renderer.js`:**
    *   The existing JavaScript logic was reviewed and confirmed to be compatible with the new HTML structure.
    *   Since the script targets the `reset-feedback-message` ID, which was preserved for the inner `span`, no changes to the JavaScript were necessary. The logic correctly controls the opacity and text content of the message, making it appear and disappear within its static container.

empty space is now static, but colored background isn't.
also the colored background is slimmer compared to those of 'salva' 'carica' and 'azzera'.
make it the same size

please make the colored background for the state of the reset static too.
only the text should fade.
in the future we might use this space for other text options too.
this is the feedback area, but it has to be distinguishable even when not in use.

as for the discussed reset without reloading
on reset save the 'currently open excercise block' somehow and reload to that! instead of the default block for the page

Addressed feedback on the reset button's feedback area and functionality.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Fixed Reset Feedback Area Styling (`src/index.html`):**
    *   Modified the `div` for the feedback message to ensure its size and background are static and consistent with adjacent buttons.
    *   Replaced the fixed height class (`h-8`) with vertical padding (`py-1`) to match the buttons' height behavior.
    *   Changed the corner rounding from `rounded-md` to `rounded-lg` for visual consistency.
    *   This ensures the background area is always visible and correctly sized, with only the text fading in and out.

2.  **Enhanced Reset Functionality (`src/renderer.js`, `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`):**
    *   Implemented the request to return the user to their position within an exercise after a reset.
    *   The `globalResetBtn` click handler in `renderer.js` now captures two pieces of state before resetting:
        - The ID of the currently active exercise phase (e.g., "fase 2").
        - The current scroll position of the content area.
    *   The `loadContentIntoTab` function in `content-loader.js` was updated to accept this state.
    *   After reloading the exercise, it now programmatically clicks the correct phase tab and restores the scroll position, placing the user exactly where they were before the reset.

the static area is not wide enough, increase it by just a few letters worth. 
also when empty it vertically collapses to be incredibly small vertically instead of staying fixed at the correct size regardless of if text is there.
reset works as requested for the excercises pages, but not for the tests page for grammar and verbs.
probably cause they are coded differently.

to clarify
the area where the text is displayed after a reset must have a static background as high as that of the other buttons
and large enough for the text that must appear inside

Addressed feedback on the reset button's feedback area and extended reset functionality to all page types.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Fixed Reset Feedback Area Styling (`src/index.html`):**
    *   Modified the `div` for the feedback message to prevent it from collapsing and to increase its size.
    *   Increased the width from `w-32` to `w-40` to provide more space for text.
    *   Replaced the vertical padding class (`py-1`) with a fixed height class (`h-8`) to ensure the container maintains its size even when the feedback text is not visible. This prevents the vertical collapse issue.

2.  **Fixed Post-Reset State Restoration for Test Pages (`src/renderer.js`, `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`):**
    *   The previous implementation failed on test pages because it made incorrect assumptions about the format of the phase/block tab IDs.
    *   In `renderer.js`, the logic was updated to store the *entire* `id` of the active tab button (e.g., `tab-block-1`) instead of just a part of it.
    *   In `content-loader.js`, the logic was updated to use this full, unmodified `id` to find and click the correct tab after reloading.
    *   This makes the state restoration logic more robust and ensures it works correctly across all content types, including exercises and tests.

---

Corrected the styling of the reset feedback area to ensure consistent height.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Re-fixed Reset Feedback Area Styling (`src/index.html`):**
    *   The previous fix using a fixed height (`h-8`) was incorrect as it did not align properly with the other buttons in the flex container.
    *   The styling was updated to use `py-1` for vertical padding, matching the adjacent buttons.
    *   To prevent the container from collapsing when empty, a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) was added to the feedback `span` in the HTML.

2.  **Updated `src/renderer.js` to Preserve Height:**
    *   The `globalResetBtn` click handler was modified.
    *   When the feedback message fades out, its content is now set to `&nbsp;` instead of an empty string. This ensures the `span` always has content, giving the container an intrinsic height and preventing it from collapsing, which maintains visual consistency in the toolbar.

a few issues still
the horizontal area of the feedback area must be expanded slightly, maybe to 40 or 42
but if i or you do that, horizontally the area collapses to abouth 1 character worth of width when the text is not displayed.

also, add more feedback displays for when a file is saved or loaded
and for when a savestate is used for the first time after a reset
'Loaded object' with object replaced by 'LX' (lesson followed by number) or 'verbs' or 'grammar'
and 'Saved object' with the same logic

consider that the horizontal width of the feedback area must be constant regardless of if it's empty or full with text
for this purpose the default width must be more than the length of any of the feedback phrases
