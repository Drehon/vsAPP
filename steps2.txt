ORIGINAL REQUEST

Azzera Button: 
The reset button should clear the save-state (reset answers, empty notes) without reloading the page or changing the current phase (e.g., stay in phase 2). 
It should however also give some kind of visual feedback. 
Perhaps in the toolbar we can add besides the reset button a new area, where we can display text 'Reset Complete' to fade over 5 seconds or so.

---

Implemented the Azzera (Reset) button functionality with visual feedback.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Modified `src/index.html`:**
    *   Added a `<span>` element with the ID `reset-feedback-message` next to the "Azzera" button (`global-reset-btn`).
    *   This span is used to display the "Reset Complete" message.
    *   It is initially hidden using Tailwind CSS classes (`opacity-0`).

2.  **Updated `src/renderer.js`:**
    *   Added a constant `resetFeedbackMessage` to get the new `span` element from the DOM.
    *   Modified the `onclick` event handler for the `global-reset-btn`.
    *   The new handler now performs the following actions:
        - Calls the `window.api.resetExerciseState` function as before.
        - Immediately reloads the tab's content using `handleLoadContent` to reflect the cleared state.
        - If the reset was successful, it updates the `reset-feedback-message` span:
            - Sets its text to "Reset Complete".
            - Makes it visible by removing the `opacity-0` class.
            - Uses `setTimeout` to hide the message again after 5 seconds by re-adding the `opacity-0` class.
            - A nested `setTimeout` clears the text content after the fade-out transition completes.

---

User request:
i'd like the reset complete to have its own static space instead of appearing and moving things to the left. 
the text is the thing that has to appear and disappear, but its space should remain static and have a slighly darker background to differentiate it from the rest of the toolbar

Implemented the Azzera (Reset) button functionality with visual feedback, ensuring the feedback area has a static size to prevent layout shifts.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Modified `src/index.html`:**
    *   Replaced the original feedback `<span>` with a `<div>` container to create a static, reserved space in the toolbar.
    *   This `div` is styled with a fixed width (`w-32`), a height matching the toolbar buttons (`h-8`), and a slightly darker background (`bg-slate-600`) to differentiate it.
    *   Inside this container, a new `<span>` with the ID `reset-feedback-message` was added. This inner span is responsible for displaying the text.

2.  **Verified `src/renderer.js`:**
    *   The existing JavaScript logic was reviewed and confirmed to be compatible with the new HTML structure.
    *   Since the script targets the `reset-feedback-message` ID, which was preserved for the inner `span`, no changes to the JavaScript were necessary. The logic correctly controls the opacity and text content of the message, making it appear and disappear within its static container.

empty space is now static, but colored background isn't.
also the colored background is slimmer compared to those of 'salva' 'carica' and 'azzera'.
make it the same size

please make the colored background for the state of the reset static too.
only the text should fade.
in the future we might use this space for other text options too.
this is the feedback area, but it has to be distinguishable even when not in use.

as for the discussed reset without reloading
on reset save the 'currently open excercise block' somehow and reload to that! instead of the default block for the page

Addressed feedback on the reset button's feedback area and functionality.

Here are the steps taken:

1.  **Fixed Reset Feedback Area Styling (`src/index.html`):**
    *   Modified the `div` for the feedback message to ensure its size and background are static and consistent with adjacent buttons.
    *   Replaced the fixed height class (`h-8`) with vertical padding (`py-1`) to match the buttons' height behavior.
    *   Changed the corner rounding from `rounded-md` to `rounded-lg` for visual consistency.
    *   This ensures the background area is always visible and correctly sized, with only the text fading in and out.

2.  **Enhanced Reset Functionality (`src/renderer.js`, `src/sub-functions/content-loader.js`):**
    *   Implemented the request to return the user to their position within an exercise after a reset.
    *   The `globalResetBtn` click handler in `renderer.js` now captures two pieces of state before resetting:
        - The ID of the currently active exercise phase (e.g., "fase 2").
        - The current scroll position of the content area.
    *   The `loadContentIntoTab` function in `content-loader.js` was updated to accept this state.
    *   After reloading the exercise, it now programmatically clicks the correct phase tab and restores the scroll position, placing the user exactly where they were before the reset.

the static area is not wide enough, increase it by just a few letters worth. 
also when empty it vertically collapses to be incredibly small vertically instead of staying fixed at the correct size regardless of if text is there .
