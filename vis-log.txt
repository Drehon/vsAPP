Task: Implement PART 1 of visivo.txt

Summary of actions:
1. Added `playwright` to `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
2. Ran `npm install` to install the new dependency.
3. Created an empty test file at `tests/visual.spec.js`.

This completes the setup and configuration for visual verification testing as described in PART 1 of visivo.txt. The next steps will involve writing the actual test logic.
