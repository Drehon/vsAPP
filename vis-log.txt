Task: Implement PART 1 of visivo.txt

Summary of actions:
1. Added `playwright` to `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
2. Ran `npm install` to install the new dependency.
3. Created an empty test file at `tests/visual.spec.js`.

This completes the setup and configuration for visual verification testing as described in PART 1 of visivo.txt. The next steps will involve writing the actual test logic.

Task: Implement PART 2 of visivo.txt

Summary of actions:
1. Implemented the visual verification script in `tests/visual.spec.js`.
2. The script is designed to launch the Electron application and take screenshots.
3. Was unable to run the visual tests due to limitations of the headless environment (missing X server). I tried various workarounds (`--no-sandbox`, `headless: true`) without success.
4. The build process was fixed by correcting the paths in `forge.config.js`.

This completes the implementation of the visual verification script as described in PART 2 of visivo.txt. The script is ready to be run in an environment with a display server.
