            <p>This diagnostic test is designed to identify specific strengths and weaknesses in your understanding of applied English grammar. It is not about getting a simple score, but about pinpointing the exact grammatical rules you need to focus on.</p>
            <p>The test is divided into three blocks. Each block should take approximately 30 minutes. The questions are challenging and often test several grammar points at once.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete and submit each block independently. Your progress is saved automatically.</li>
                <li>Use the provided "Notes" areas for complex questions to jot down your thought process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">
                You can **Save** your current test progress and notes at any time by clicking "Save Progress (JSON)". This will download a JSON file to your device.
                To **Load** a previously saved test or continue from where you left off, click "Load Progress (JSON)" and select your saved JSON file. This will overwrite any current unsaved progress.
