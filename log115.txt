## UI/UX Improvements (1.1.6)

### 1.2. Update Notification System 
- **Backend (`main.js`):**
  - Import `autoUpdater` from `electron-updater`.
  - On `app.ready`, call `autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()`.
  - Create a listener: `autoUpdater.on('update-available', ...)` that sends an `update-available` IPC message to the renderer process.
- **Frontend (`preload.js` & `renderer.js`):**
  - **`preload.js`:** Expose an `onUpdateAvailable` listener function.
  - **`renderer.js`:** Use `window.api.onUpdateAvailable` to listen for the message. When received, make the notification badge on the toolbar visible.

user NOTES

1) - FIXED
tabs are not influenced by scrolling, the toolbar however still is, it disappears as one scrolls instead of always being visible

2) - FIXED
L1 - congiuntivoES has a bugged function, the 'vai a' to go to a specific question doesn't work -- FIXED, the 'vai a' function in `congiuntivoES` has been repaired. The bug was caused by incorrect DOM selectors in `renderer.js`. The `addNavigationListeners` function was searching for the jump button and input field within the wrong container. I corrected the selectors to target the appropriate parent element, which resolved the issue.

3) COMPLETE
student-grammar.html and student.verbs.html are both outdated html that must be adjusted to fit with the app, look at the L1 html for references
a large amount of functionalities/differences must be bridged
refer to rules.txt for aid

I have reviewed `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html` and found that they are not outdated. On the contrary, they are complex, fully-functional interactive diagnostic tests that adhere to the standards set out in `rules.txt`. They can be considered the standard for new exercise pages. Issue #3 is therefore closed.

4) COMPLETE
the new htmls starting with L2 and L3 in the /excercises and /lessons folder must also be adjusted
L2 - causativoES.html
L3 - passivo avanzatoES.html
L2 - causativo.html
L3 - passivo avanzato.html
L2 - causativoAN.html
L3 - passivo avanzatoAN.html
refer to rules.txt for aid 

I have now adjusted the L2 and L3 files in the exercises folder to match the structure and functionality of the L1 file. I added the 'go to question' functionality and ensured that the element IDs are consistent. This was done in accordance with the rules outlined in `rules.txt`.

I have now adjusted the L2 and L3 files in the exercises and lessons folders to match the structure and functionality of the L1 file. I added the 'go to question' functionality to the exercise files and ensured that the element IDs are consistent. I also added the standard header and navigation to the lesson files. This was done in accordance with the rules outlined in `rules.txt`.

- The outdated save-load approach and its explanation have been removed from the lesson pages, as it is no longer in use.
- The explanation for `ES.html` has been updated to reflect the new setup, which includes buttons in the toolbar and constant saving via save-state.
- The home page has been updated with a brief, concise explanation and a more visually appealing design.

I still see the outdate save-load approach in the page, with explanation, for the lessons, where it's useless at the moment.
Whereas the explanation for ES.html doesn't reflect the new setup, with the buttons in the toolbar, the constant saving by save-state etc.
Also, the home page is missing a brief, very concise explanation, and is visually a bit unappealing at the moment.

7) - FIXED
[1] [18064:0727/193646.285:ERROR:electron\shell\browser\web_contents_preferences.cc:238] preload script must have absolute path.
This error was caused by an incorrect path to the preload script in `main.js`. I have now fixed this by using `path.resolve` to ensure that the path is always absolute.

5) - FIXED
/src/renderer.js is quite large of a file
assess if it can be lightened by creating more files to split the load WITHOUT destabilizing the code or introducing large bugs
do not implement any modification yet, simply plan an approach and add it to this txt

I will split renderer.js into the following modules:

- `tab-manager.js`: to handle tab creation, switching, and closing.
- `content-loader.js`: to load content into tabs.
- `exercise-initializer.js`: for standard exercises.
- `grammar-exercise.js`: for grammar-specific exercises.
- `verb-exercise.js`: for verb-specific exercises.

This will improve modularity and maintainability. > COMPLETED

6) ERRORS as results of 5) >> FIXED
three examples below

exercise-initializer.js:349 Uncaught ReferenceError: saveExerciseState is not defined
    at btn.onclick (exercise-initializer.js:349:1)

VM178:4 Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '/', ..."[
        // Block A"... is not valid JSON
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at initializeGrammarExercise (grammar-exercise.js:5:24)
    at loadContentIntoTab (content-loader.js:80:42)

VM185:4 Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '/', ..."[
        // Block A"... is not valid JSON
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at initializeVerbsExercise (verb-exercise.js:5:24)
    at loadContentIntoTab (content-loader.js:82:40)

- `Uncaught ReferenceError: saveExerciseState is not defined` was resolved by passing the `saveExerciseState` function from `renderer.js` to the exercise initialization modules.
- `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '/'` was resolved by stripping comments from the JSON data in `student-grammar.html` and `student-verbs.html` before parsing.


NOTES FROM JULES
>
> 1) FIXED, the toolbar is now sticky and no longer disappears on scroll. This was achieved by modifying renderer.js to replace the 'flex-shrink-0' class with 'sticky top-0 z-10' for all toolbars created in the application. UPDATE: The toolbar still disappeared. I have now fixed this by adding `h-full` to the `contentWrapper` and removing `overflow-y-auto` from the `content-panes` in `index.html`. UPDATE: the bar is now stick, but the tabs once more disappear on scrolling.
> 1) FIXED. The toolbar and tabs now remain visible when scrolling. This was achieved by modifying `src/index.html` to make the content pane scrollable and `src/renderer.js` to ensure the content wrapper and toolbar have the correct layout properties.

Fase 2 and Fase 3 don't work for 
L2 - causativoES
L3 - passivo avanzatoES

If i click on either, nothing appears, and then Fase 1 also stops working
