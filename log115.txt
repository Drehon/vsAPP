NEXT STEPS

user NOTES
1) tabs are not influenced by scrolling, the toolbar however still is, it disappears as one scrolls instead of always being visible
2) student-grammar.html and student.verbs.html are both outdated html that must be adjusted to fit with the app, look at the L1 html for references
3) L1 - congiuntivoES has a bugged function, the 'vai a' to go to a specific question doesn't work
4) the new htmls starting with L2 and L3 in the excercises and lessons folder must also be adjusted
