## UI/UX Improvements (1.1.6)

### 1.2. Update Notification System 
- **Backend (`main.js`):**
  - Import `autoUpdater` from `electron-updater`.
  - On `app.ready`, call `autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()`.
  - Create a listener: `autoUpdater.on('update-available', ...)` that sends an `update-available` IPC message to the renderer process.
- **Frontend (`preload.js` & `renderer.js`):**
  - **`preload.js`:** Expose an `onUpdateAvailable` listener function.
  - **`renderer.js`:** Use `window.api.onUpdateAvailable` to listen for the message. When received, make the notification badge on the toolbar visible.

NEXT STEPS
user NOTES

1) - FIXED
tabs are not influenced by scrolling, the toolbar however still is, it disappears as one scrolls instead of always being visible

2) 
L1 - congiuntivoES has a bugged function, the 'vai a' to go to a specific question doesn't work

3) 
student-grammar.html and student.verbs.html are both outdated html that must be adjusted to fit with the app, look at the L1 html for references
a large amount of functionalities/differences must be bridged

4) 
the new htmls starting with L2 and L3 in the excercises and lessons folder must also be adjusted

5)
/src/renderer.js is quite large of a file
assess if it can be lightened by creating more files to split the load WITHOUT destabilizing the code or introducing large bugs
do not implement any modification yet, simply plan an approach and add it to this txt

NOTES FROM JULES
>
> 1) FIXED, the toolbar is now sticky and no longer disappears on scroll. This was achieved by modifying renderer.js to replace the 'flex-shrink-0' class with 'sticky top-0 z-10' for all toolbars created in the application. UPDATE: The toolbar still disappeared. I have now fixed this by adding `h-full` to the `contentWrapper` and removing `overflow-y-auto` from the `content-panes` in `index.html`. UPDATE: the bar is now stick, but the tabs once more disappear on scrolling.
> 1) FIXED. The toolbar and tabs now remain visible when scrolling. This was achieved by modifying `src/index.html` to make the content pane scrollable and `src/renderer.js` to ensure the content wrapper and toolbar have the correct layout properties.
