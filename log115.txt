NEXT STEPS
user NOTES

1) 
tabs are not influenced by scrolling, the toolbar however still is, it disappears as one scrolls instead of always being visible

2) 
L1 - congiuntivoES has a bugged function, the 'vai a' to go to a specific question doesn't work

3) 
student-grammar.html and student.verbs.html are both outdated html that must be adjusted to fit with the app, look at the L1 html for references
a large amount of functionalities/differences must be bridged

4) 
the new htmls starting with L2 and L3 in the excercises and lessons folder must also be adjusted

5)
/src/renderer.js is quite large of a file
assess if it can be lightened by creating more files to split the load WITHOUT destabilizing the code or introducing large bugs
do not implement any modification yet, simply plan an approach and add it to this txt
