**Completed Steps:**

1.  **Create a Node.js Script (`scripts/update-patch-notes.js`):**
    *   The script has been created and is responsible for reading `patchnotes.json`, generating the HTML content, and updating `others/patch-notes.html`.
    *   It uses the `fs` module to read and write files.
    *   The script reads the `patchnotes.json` file from the root of the project.
    *   It uses a template file (`patch-notes-template.html`) that contains a placeholder `<!-- PATCH_NOTES_CONTENT -->`.
    *   The script iterates over the patch notes from the JSON data and generates the corresponding HTML for each note.
    *   The generated HTML replaces the placeholder in the template.
    *   The script writes the updated content to `others/patch-notes.html`.

2.  **Create a Template File (`others/patch-notes-template.html`):**
    *   The template file has been created. It is a copy of the original `others/patch-notes.html`, with the list of patch notes replaced by a single placeholder comment: `<main id="patch-notes-container" class="space-y-8"><!-- PATCH_NOTES_CONTENT --></main>`.

3.  **Update `package.json`:**
    *   The `scripts` section in `package.json` has been modified to include the new script in the `publish` command.
    *   A `prepublishOnly` script has been added: `"prepublishOnly": "node ./scripts/update-patch-notes.js"`.

4.  **Add to `.gitignore`:**
    *   The generated file `others/patch-notes.html` has been added to the `.gitignore` file.

**Next Steps:**

*   All planned steps are complete. The `patch-notes.html` file will be automatically updated with the latest patch notes every time `npm run publish` is executed.
*   Submit the changes.
