# Test Notes

## Testing Instructions

1.  **Open two separate terminals** in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **In the first terminal, run the CSS build command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```
    This command will watch for changes in the CSS files and automatically recompile them. You should see a message indicating that it is watching for changes.
3.  **In the second terminal, run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Electron application.

## Expected Results

*   The application window should open.
*   The application should display a list of lessons and exercises.
*   The application should display the version number.
*   The application should be styled correctly.

## Current Status

The application is not loading the lessons, exercises, or the app version. The styling is also not being applied.

## Error Log

```

The Autofill errors are not relevant to the current issues.

## How the Tailwind Issue Was Fixed

We resolved the Tailwind CSS issue by ensuring the following steps were completed:

1. **Installed Tailwind CSS** as a development dependency using `npm install -D tailwindcss`.
2. **Created a Tailwind configuration file** (`tailwind.config.js`) with `npx tailwindcss init` if it did not already exist.
3. **Added a build script** to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "build:css": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/style.css --watch"
   ```
4. **Ran the build script** with `npm run build:css` to generate the CSS file.
5. **Ensured the generated CSS file** (`src/style.css`) is correctly imported in the applicationâ€™s HTML or main JS file.

This setup allows Tailwind CSS to process and apply styles correctly in

## Possible Issue 1

PS C:\Users\User\Documents\TEFL Personal> npm run build:css

> tutoring-app@1.0.0 build:css
> npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/style.css --watch

Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run:
  npx update-browserslist-db@latest
  Why you should do it regularly: https://github.com/browserslist/update-db#readme

Rebuilding...

warn - Your `content` configuration includes a pattern which looks like it's accidentally matching all of `node_modules` and can cause serious performance issues.
warn - Pattern: `./**\*.js`
warn - See our documentation for recommendations:

MOST RECENT update
Template now loads, but the autofill issue persists.
Not sure if they are the same issue, but app still says 'nessuna lezione trovata', 'nessun esercizio trovato'. 
basically it finds no content to load

### Analysis of the Issues

I've analyzed the error logs and the source code (`main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`). Here's my diagnosis:

The primary issue is the failure of the `preload.js` script to execute correctly. This is indicated by the error `Error: module not found: fs`. This error is misleading; `fs` is a built-in Node.js module and should be available in the preload script's context. The actual problem is likely that the build tool (Vite or a similar bundler) is trying to bundle the `fs` module for the renderer environment, where it's not available. The line `const fs = require('fs').promises;` in `preload.js` was the likely culprit, as it was unnecessary for the script's functionality.

The failure of the preload script means that the `api` object is not exposed to the `window` of the renderer process. This causes the subsequent errors in `renderer.js`:
- `Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: directory is not defined`: This was a typo in an error message in `renderer.js`.
- `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getAppVersion')`: This error occurs because `window.api` is `undefined`, so `window.api.getAppVersion()` fails.
- The inability to load lessons and exercises is also because `window.api` is `undefined`, so `window.api.getLessons()` and `window.api.getExercises()` fail.

### Steps Taken to Resolve the Issues

1.  **Fixed `src/preload.js`:** I removed the line `const fs = require('fs').promises;` from `src/preload.js`. This module was not being used in the preload script and was likely causing the bundling error.
2.  **Fixed `src/renderer.js`:** I corrected a typo in an error message in `src/renderer.js`, replacing the undefined variable `directory` with the correct parameter `type`.

### Expected Next Steps

With these changes, the `preload.js` script should now execute correctly, exposing the `api` object to the renderer process. 
This should resolve the errors in `renderer.js` and allow the application to load the lessons, exercises, and app version as expected. 
The application should be tested to confirm that the content now loads correctly.

## Jules's Final Notes

### Analysis of the Issues

The primary issue was the failure of the `preload.js` script to execute correctly. This was caused by the build process (Webpack) attempting to bundle Node.js built-in modules (`fs` and `path`) for the renderer environment, where they are not available. This prevented the `api` object from being exposed to the renderer process, leading to the errors in `renderer.js`.

### Steps Taken to Resolve the Issues

1.  **Installed `@electron-forge/plugin-webpack`**: I added this package to the `devDependencies` to enable proper webpack configuration.
2.  **Fixed `forge.config.js`**: I added a `webpack` plugin configuration to `forge.config.js` to exclude the `path` module from being bundled. This allows the `preload.js` script to load correctly.
3.  **Removed unnecessary `require('path')` from `src/preload.js`**: I removed the line `const path = require('path');` from `src/preload.js` as it was not being used and was causing a bundling error.

### Expected Next Steps

With these changes, the `preload.js` script should now execute correctly, exposing the `api` object to the renderer process. This should resolve the errors in `renderer.js` and allow the application to load the lessons, exercises, and app version as expected.
