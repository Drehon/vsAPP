# Test Notes

## Testing Instructions

1.  **Open two separate terminals** in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **In the first terminal, run the CSS build command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```
    This command will watch for changes in the CSS files and automatically recompile them. You should see a message indicating that it is watching for changes.
3.  **In the second terminal, run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Electron application.

## Expected Results

*   The application window should open.
*   The application should display a list of lessons and exercises.
*   The application should display the version number.
*   The application should be styled correctly.

## Current Status

The application is not loading the lessons, exercises, or the app version. The styling is also not being applied.
