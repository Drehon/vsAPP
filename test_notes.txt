# Test Notes

## Testing Instructions

1.  **Open two separate terminals** in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **In the first terminal, run the CSS build command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```
    This command will watch for changes in the CSS files and automatically recompile them. You should see a message indicating that it is watching for changes.
3.  **In the second terminal, run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Electron application.

## Expected Results

*   The application window should open.
*   The application should display a list of lessons and exercises.
*   The application should display the version number.
*   The application should be styled correctly.

## Current Status

The application is not loading the lessons, exercises, or the app version. The styling is also not being applied.

## Error Log

The Autofill errors are not relevant to the current issues.

## How the Tailwind Issue Was Fixed

We resolved the Tailwind CSS issue by ensuring the following steps were completed:

1. **Installed Tailwind CSS** as a development dependency using `npm install -D tailwindcss`.
2. **Created a Tailwind configuration file** (`tailwind.config.js`) with `npx tailwindcss init` if it did not already exist.
3. **Added a build script** to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "build:css": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/style.css --watch"
   ```
4. **Ran the build script** with `npm run build:css` to generate the CSS file.
5. **Ensured the generated CSS file** (`src/style.css`) is correctly imported in the applicationâ€™s HTML or main JS file.

This setup allows Tailwind CSS to process and apply styles correctly in

MOST RECENT update
Template now loads, but the autofill issue persists.
Not sure if they are the same issue, but app still says 'nessuna lezione trovata', 'nessun esercizio trovato'. 
basically it finds no content to load
i looked up the developer app console (i think that's what it is) and can see the following:
