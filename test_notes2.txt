ISSUE C1 - FIXED (Removed style.css link from index.html and imported it into renderer.js)
index.html:1 Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:3000/main_window/style.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.

ISSUE C2 - UNFIXED
WAS FIXED - removed style.css link from index.html, it's now imported in renderer.js
Is now back after fixing C2B
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

ISSUE C2B - FIXED (Changed src attribute of script in index.html to be a relative path)
Appeared after C2 got fixed
GET http://localhost:3000/main_window/src/renderer.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)

ISSUE C3 - FIXED? (Issue disappeared when C1 was fixed)
Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:3000/main_window/style.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.

ISSUE C4 - FIXED (Added `node: { __dirname: false }` to `webpack.renderer.config.js` to prevent webpack from polyfilling `__dirname` in the renderer process)
Uncaught ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined

ISSUE c4B
FAILED TO FIX (updated `getContents` in `main.js` to correctly locate content directories in development and production)
FAILED TO FIX (Added `__filename: false` to `webpack.renderer.config.js` to prevent webpack from polyfilling `__filename` in the renderer process)
FAILED TO FIX (set `__dirname: true` in `webpack.renderer.config.js` to enable polyfilling in the renderer process)
FAILED TO FIX  (set `nodeIntegration: true` for the renderer in `forge.config.js`)

Reasoning: The error `__dirname is not defined` occurs because the renderer process, by default, does not have access to Node.js globals for security reasons. The previous attempts to fix this by modifying `webpack.renderer.config.js` were incorrect for the version of webpack being used. The correct way to enable Node.js globals in the renderer process for this version of Electron Forge is to set `nodeIntegration: true` in the renderer's configuration within `forge.config.js`. This makes `__dirname` and other Node.js globals available to the renderer's bundled code.
