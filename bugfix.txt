Bug Fix: L2 - causativoES and L3 - passivo avanzatoES fase 1 and 2 incorrectly marking answers.

Hypothesis:
The issue seems to be in the JavaScript code that checks the answers for multiple-choice questions. The comparison between the user's selected answer and the correct answer is likely incorrect. The user's answer is being compared as a boolean (true/false) or the full text of the answer, while the stored correct answer is a letter ("A", "B", "C", or "D").

Plan:
1.  **Update `checkAnswers` function in `exercises/L2 - causativoES.html`**: Modify the `checkAnswers` function to correctly compare the user's answer with the correct answer from the JSON data. For multiple-choice questions, ensure the comparison is between the selected option's value ("A", "B", etc.) and the `answer` field in the JSON.
2.  **Update `checkAnswers` function in `exercises/L3 - passivo avanzatoES.html`**: Apply the same fix to the `checkAnswers` function in this file.
3.  **Create `bugfix.txt`**: Create the `bugfix.txt` file and add the initial analysis and plan.
4.  **Verify the fix**: Manually test the exercises to ensure that answers are now correctly marked.
5.  **Submit the changes**: Once the fix is verified, submit the changes with a clear commit message.

Steps Taken:
- Investigated the code and found the incorrect logic in the `checkAnswers` function in both `exercises/L2 - causativoES.html` and `exercises/L3 - passivo avanzatoES.html`.
- Corrected the logic to properly compare the user's selected answer with the correct answer.
- Created this `bugfix.txt` file to document the process.
- Added console.log statements to both files to debug the values being compared.
