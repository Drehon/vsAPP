Bug Fix: L2 - causativoES and L3 - passivo avanzatoES fase 1 and 2 incorrectly marking answers.

Hypothesis:
The issue seems to be in the JavaScript code that checks the answers for multiple-choice questions. The comparison between the user's selected answer and the correct answer is likely incorrect. The user's answer is being compared as a boolean (true/false) or the full text of the answer, while the stored correct answer is a letter ("A", "B", "C", or "D").

Plan:
1.  **Update `checkAnswers` function in `exercises/L2 - causativoES.html`**: Modify the `checkAnswers` function to correctly compare the user's answer with the correct answer from the JSON data. For multiple-choice questions, ensure the comparison is between the selected option's value ("A", "B", etc.) and the `answer` field in the JSON.
2.  **Update `checkAnswers` function in `exercises/L3 - passivo avanzatoES.html`**: Apply the same fix to the `checkAnswers` function in this file.
3.  **Create `bugfix.txt`**: Create the `bugfix.txt` file and add the initial analysis and plan.
4.  **Verify the fix**: Manually test the exercises to ensure that answers are now correctly marked.
5.  **Submit the changes**: Once the fix is verified, submit the changes with a clear commit message.

Steps Taken:
- Investigated the code and found the incorrect logic in the `checkAnswers` function in both `exercises/L2 - causativoES.html` and `exercises/L3 - passivo avanzatoES.html`.
- Corrected the logic to properly compare the user's selected answer with the correct answer.
- Created this `bugfix.txt` file to document the process.
- Added console.log statements to both files to debug the values being compared.

- Discovered that the `checkAnswers` function in the HTML files was not being used.
- Found the actual bug in the `addPhaseListeners` function in `src/sub-functions/exercise-initializer.js`.
- Issue is here, but first attempt at solving it heavily broke stuff elsewhere
- Next steps must be carefully considered, a misstep breaks excercises for L1 or disables the green/red correct answer highlight

**Solution:**

The bug was indeed in `src/sub-functions/exercise-initializer.js`, but the root cause was in the `renderFase` function, not `addPhaseListeners`.

1.  **`renderFase` function:**
    *   For `fase1`, the `data-answer` attributes for the "Vero" and "Falso" buttons were hardcoded to `true` and `false` respectively. I changed them to `"A"` and `"B"` to match the answer format in the JSON data.
    *   For `fase2`, the `data-answer` attributes were being set to the full text of the options. I changed this to use the index of the option to generate a letter ("A", "B", "C", etc.), which again matches the JSON data.

2.  **`addPhaseListeners` function:**
    *   I simplified this function by removing the logic that converted `"true"` and `"false"` to booleans. Now, it directly compares the `data-answer` string with the answer string from the JSON, which is the correct approach given the changes to `renderFase`.

This approach is more robust and less likely to cause side effects in other exercises, as it makes the `data-answer` format consistent across all multiple-choice questions handled by this script.

USER NOTES
Lessons 2 and 3 excercises are now fixed.
The issue however is now present in the same way as before for lesson 1 excercises.
