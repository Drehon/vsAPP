# Refactoring Plan for `index.html` and `home-template.html`

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a refactoring plan for `index.html` and `home-template.html`. The goal of this refactoring is to modernize the front-end architecture of the application, making it more modular, maintainable, and easier to develop for in the future. The current implementation suffers from a monolithic structure and tight coupling, which makes modifications difficult and error-prone.

## 2. Proposed Architecture

The proposed architecture will be based on a component-based model. The main UI elements will be broken down into smaller, reusable components. This will allow for better separation of concerns and make the codebase easier to understand and manage.

The proposed components are:
*   **Toolbar Component**: This component will encapsulate the functionality of the main application toolbar.
*   **Tab Bar Component**: This component will manage the tabs for the different sections of the application.
*   **Content Area Component**: This component will be responsible for rendering the main content of the application, such as lessons and exercises.
*   **Updater Component**: This component will handle the application's update functionality.

## 3. Refactoring `index.html`

The `index.html` file will be refactored to serve as the main application shell. It will contain the basic HTML structure and will be responsible for loading the different UI components. The toolbar and tab bar will be moved into their own HTML files and loaded dynamically.

## 4. Refactoring `home-template.html`

The `home-template.html` file will be refactored to be a simple template for the home page. It will no longer contain any application logic. The updater and current patch information will be moved into their own components and loaded dynamically.

## 5. Benefits of Refactoring

The proposed refactoring will provide several benefits, including:
*   **Improved Maintainability**: By breaking the application down into smaller components, it will be easier to maintain and update individual parts of the UI without affecting other parts.
*   **Increased Reusability**: The new components will be reusable, which will reduce code duplication and make it easier to build new features.
*   **Better Separation of Concerns**: The new architecture will provide a clear separation between the application's UI and its logic, which will make the codebase easier to understand and reason about.
*   **Easier Future Development**: The new architecture will make it easier for developers to add new features and make changes to the application in the future.
